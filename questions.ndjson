["Mynheer Boxtel went to the headsman, to whom he gave himself out as a great friend of the condemned man; and from whom he bought all the clothes of the dead man that was to be, for one hundred guilders; rather an exorbitant sum, as he engaged to leave all the trinkets of gold and silver to the executioner.", "But what was the sum of a hundred guilders to a man who was all but sure to buy with it the prize of the Haarlem Society?"]
["After this, the reader may imagine how excited Boxtel was; with what anxiety he watched the guards, the Recorder, and the executioner; and with what intense interest he surveyed the movements of Van Baerle.", "How would he place himself on the block?", "how would he fall?", "and would he not, in falling, crush those inestimable bulbs?", "had not he at least taken care to enclose them in a golden box,--as gold is the hardest of all metals?"]
["Why did that stupid executioner thus lose time in brandishing his sword over the head of Cornelius, instead of cutting that head off?"]
["let us speak low: my father follows on my heels,\" said the girl.", "Your father?"]
["The instructions of the Governor?"]
["The Prince could not have suspected my object; had he known it, he would have refused my request, but as it is he granted it.\"", "And so you are here?"]
["And thus I shall see you every day?"]
["Oh, Rosa, my beautiful Rosa, do you love me a little?", "A little?"]
["His Highness has granted you your life; I'm sure I should never have done so.\"", "Don't say so,\" replied Cornelius; \"why not?"]
["After six weeks, I was able to use it as if nothing had happened, so much so, that the doctor of the Buytenhof, who knows his trade well, wanted to break it again, to set it in the regular way, and promised me that I should have my blessed three months for my money before I should be able to move it.\"", "And you did not want that?"]
["But, for all that, I say his Highness has made a great mistake.\"", "\"Not to have cut off my head?"]
["I do not quite understand it.\"", "Well, then, if you had remained on the block of Master Harbruck----\" \"What?"]
["It was still light enough to see, although indistinctly, through the gray haze of the evening, the vast expanse of the horizon.", "What view has one from here?"]
["Oh, my good Rosa.", "You are then glad to see me?", "\"Can you ask?", "But how did you contrive to get here?"]
["He had not yet dared to ask Rosa what she had done with the precious treasure which he had intrusted to her.", "Oh, you have preserved them, then?", "Did you not give them to me as a thing which was dear to you?"]
["I then left for Leyden, and the rest you know.\"", "What, my dear Rosa, you thought, even before receiving my letter, of coming to meet me again?"]
["Troth,\" she said, laughing, \"to read all the letters which were written to me.", "Oh, you received letters, Rosa?"]
["But who wrote to you?"]
["And what did you do with all these notes, my dear Rosa?"]
["We have a very fine garden,\" said Rosa, \"it runs along the edge of the Waal, and is full of fine old trees.", "Could you bring me some soil from the garden, that I may judge?"]
["I will listen.", "On moonlight nights have you ever looked at your garden, my dear child?"]
["\"I will observe, and if there are cats or rats----\" \"You will apprise me of it,--that's right.", "What animal?"]
["Cornelius kissed most tenderly the tips of her fingers.", "Did he do so because the hand kept one of the bulbs of the great black tulip, or because this hand was Rosa's?"]
["Rosa withdrew with the other two suckers, pressing them to her heart.", "Did she press them to her heart because they were the bulbs of the great black tulip, or because she had them from Cornelius?"]
["He might one day find Loewestein dull, or the air of the place unhealthy, or the gin bad, and leave the fortress, and take his daughter with him, when Cornelius and Rosa would again be separated.", "Of what use would the carrier pigeons then be?"]
["Rosa smiled, and quietly shrugged her shoulders.", "Will you remain for ever in prison?", "she said, \"and after having granted you your life, will not his Highness also grant you your liberty?"]
["Yes, yes, and I am as anxious as you are, Rosa, that you should learn to read.", "When shall we begin?"]
["No, to-morrow.", "Why to-morrow?"]
["\"Already?"]
["He is a good sort of fellow, fond of his bottle, tells funny stories, and moreover is very free with his money, so as always to be ready to stand a treat.\"", "You don't know anything further of him?"]
["I don't believe that,\" said Rosa, smiling; \"if that worthy person is spying after any one, it is certainly not after my father.", "After whom, then?"]
["You?", "Why not?"]
["I don't say anything to the contrary.", "What cause have you to entertain such a happy prospect?"]
["Thank you, Rosa, you are right; well, I will say then, this fear?"]
["At the Hague his pretext was that he wanted to see you.\"", "See me?"]
["Go on, Rosa, pray do, that I may guess who that man is, and what he wants.", "Are you quite sure, Mynheer Cornelius, that none of your friends can interest himself for you?"]
["\"Oh, yes, yes, he is in love with you,\" said Cornelius.", "\"Is he young?"]
["Saying this he looked anxiously at Rosa, eagerly waiting for her answer.", "\"Young?"]
["He is hideous to look at; crooked, nearly fifty years of age, and never dares to look me in the face, or to speak, except in an undertone.", "And his name?"]
["To be sure I don't.", "Then you wish me to keep my mind easy?"]
["Well, then, now as you begin to know how to read you will read all that I write to you of the pangs of jealousy and of absence, won't you, Rosa?"]
["This small germ has caused me a much greater emotion than the order of his Highness which turned aside the sword already raised at the Buytenhof.\"", "You hope, then?"]
["Yes, yes, I hope.", "And I, in my turn, when shall I plant my bulb?"]
["But good night, my poor captive gentleman.\"", "\"How?"]
["Here she listened uneasily.", "What is it?"]
["I thought I heard something.", "What, then?"]
["Surely,\" said the prisoner, \"that cannot be Master Gryphus, he is always heard at a distance.", "No, it is not my father, I am quite sure, but----\" \"But?"]
["As ill luck would have it, his coarse, hard hand, the same which he had broken, and which Cornelius van Baerle had set so well, grasped at once in the midst of the jug, on the spot where the bulb was lying in the soil.", "What have you got here?"]
["and with this he grabbed in the soil.", "\"I?"]
["\"Ah!", "have I caught you?"]
["\"Take care, sir, take care,\" said Cornelius, growing quite pale.", "\"Care of what?"]
["For shame, my father,\" Rosa chimed in, \"it is indeed a crime you have committed here.", "Ah, is that you, my little chatter-box?"]
["Rosa's Lover Rosa had scarcely pronounced these consolatory words when a voice was heard from the staircase asking Gryphus how matters were going on.", "Do you hear, father?"]
["What?"]
["\"There was such a noise,\" said Gryphus; \"wouldn't you have thought he would murder me, this doctor?"]
["Her first words announced to Cornelius that henceforth her father would make no objection to his cultivating flowers.", "And how do you know that?"]
["This repentance is not of himself.", "And who put it into him?"]
["Ah, Master Jacob; he does not leave you, then, that Master Jacob?"]
["Saying this, she smiled in such a way that the little cloud of jealousy which had darkened the brow of Cornelius speedily vanished.", "How was it?"]
["Then, turning toward me, he asked, 'But it was not the only one that he had?'", "Did he ask that?"]
["\"I did not know what to answer, as you had so strictly enjoined me never to allow any one to guess the interest which you are taking in the bulb.", "Fortunately, my father saved me from the difficulty by chiming in,-- \"'What did he say?"]
["\"'Well, now, are you mad?'", "cried my father; 'what immense misfortune is it to crush a tulip bulb?"]
["I quite incautiously replied.\"", "And what did Jacob say or do at these words?"]
["\"'What do I know?'", "I said, negligently; 'do I understand anything of tulips?"]
["cried Cornelius.", "Did you say that I have three?"]
["\"Tell me, Rosa,\" continued Cornelius, with a pensive air.", "What?", "Did you not tell me that on the day when you prepared your borders this man followed you?"]
["That he glided like a shadow behind the elder trees?"]
["That not one of your movements escaped him?"]
["\"Rosa,\" said Cornelius, growing quite pale.", "Well?"]
["Who else, then?"]
["But with whom else?"]
["And yet it is very possible,\" said Rosa.", "Will you make sure of it?", "In what manner?"]
["Feign to put the bulb into the ground; leave the garden, but look through the keyhole of the door and watch him.\"", "Well, and what then?", "\"What then?"]
["To tell the truth,\" said the prisoner, sighing likewise, \"since your father crushed that unfortunate bulb, I feel as if part of my own self had been paralyzed.", "Now just hear me,\" said Rosa; \"will you try something else?", "What?", "Will you accept the proposition of my father?", "Which proposition?", "Did not he offer to you tulip bulbs by hundreds?"]
["she said.", "What is it?"]
["I see one thing.", "What do you see?"]
["On the following day Gryphus appeared to him even more hideous, brutal, and hateful than usual; in his mind, or rather in his heart, there had been some hope that it was the old man who prevented his daughter from coming.", "In his wrath he would have strangled Gryphus, but would not this have separated him for ever from Rosa?"]
["said Jacob.", "What do you mean?"]
["Accordingly I am come to see whether there might not be some remedy to restore you to health.\"", "Restore me to health?"]
["again!", "Have I not told you, Rosa, that I thought but of you?"]
["Yes,\" she said, \"you have guessed the truth; that suitor and amorous swain, Jacob, did not come on my account.", "And what did he come for?"]
["I do hate him,\" said Rosa, \"as he is the cause of all the unhappiness I have suffered these eight days.", "\"You, too, have been unhappy, Rosa?"]
["Well, on the day after that unfortunate one, I went down into the garden and proceeded towards the border where I was to plant your tulip, looking round all the while to see whether I was again followed as I was last time.", "And then?"]
["And then the same shadow glided between the gate and the wall, and once more disappeared behind the elder-trees.", "You feigned not to see him, didn't you?"]
["Yes, and I stooped over the border, in which I dug with a spade, as if I was going to put the bulb in.", "And he,--what did he do during all this time?"]
["Then, after having finished my make-believe work, I retired.", "But only behind the garden door, I dare say, so that you might see through the keyhole what he was going to do when you had left?"]
["I guessed his intentions.", "But the bulb, Rosa; what have you done with it?"]
["\"The bulb?"]
["\"Where?"]
["\"Good Heaven, what imprudence!", "What is it?", "In what sort of soil is it?", "In what aspect?", "Good or bad?"]
["said Cornelius, somewhat relieved.", "\"But in what soil?", "in what vessel?"]
["I have heard you and that detestable Jacob, as you call him, so often talk about what is the soil best fitted for growing tulips, that I know it as well as the first gardener of Haarlem.\"", "And now what is the aspect, Rosa?"]
["\"Yes, six days, Mynheer Cornelius,\" she answered.", "And it does not yet show leaf?"]
["\"Well, then, to-morrow you will bring me news about it, and about yourself, won't you, Rosa?"]
["To-morrow?"]
["Well,\"--Cornelius at last broke the silence,--\"well, Rosa, everything changes in the realm of nature; the flowers of spring are succeeded by other flowers; and the bees, which so tenderly caressed the violets and the wall-flowers, will flutter with just as much love about the honey-suckles, the rose, the jessamine, and the carnation.", "What does all this mean?"]
["have I not been faithful to you?\"", "Do you call it faithful to desert me, and to leave me here to die?", "\"But, Mynheer Cornelius,\" said Rosa, \"am I not doing everything for you that could give you pleasure?"]
["Above and before everything in this world, Rosa.", "May I believe you?"]
["Unfortunately, it does not bind me more than I am bound; but it binds you, Rosa, you.", "To what?"]
["Then you are condemned to death, and whilst walking to the scaffold, you devote to her your last sigh; and now you expect poor me to sacrifice to you all my dreams and my happiness.\"", "But who is the beauty you are talking of, Rosa?"]
["\"That is an imaginary lady love, at all events; whereas, without counting that amorous Jacob, you by your own account are surrounded with all sorts of swains eager to make love to you.", "Do you remember Rosa, what you told me of the students, officers, and clerks of the Hague?"]
["Indeed there are, and lots of them.", "Who write letters?"]
["\"And now, as you know how to read----\" Here Cornelius heaved a sigh at the thought, that, poor captive as he was, to him alone Rosa owed the faculty of reading the love-letters which she received.", "\"How so?"]
["\"Indeed, your instructions, sir,\" said Rosa, sighing in her turn; \"have you forgotten the will written by your hand on the Bible of Cornelius de Witt?"]
["exclaimed the jailer.", "How are you this morning?"]
["Gryphus looked at him with a scowl.", "And how is the dog, and Master Jacob, and our pretty Rosa?"]
["said Gryphus.", "And why not?"]
["\"The conspiracy seems to thrive,\" remarked Gryphus.", "What conspiracy?"]
["Saying this, Gryphus went out.", "At noon?", "repeated Cornelius; \"what does that mean?"]
["And lastly, the light would have shown her blushes.", "Of what did the young people speak that evening?"]
["He found Rosa pretty, good, graceful, and charming.", "But why did Rosa object to the tulip being spoken of?"]
["\"She is up!", "Who?"]
["asked Cornelius, who did not venture on a belief that Rosa would, of her own accord, have abridged the term of his probation.", "\"She?"]
["He guessed that this unexpected kiss had frightened Rosa.", "Is it growing up straight?"]
["How high?"]
["Oh, Rosa, take good care of it, and we shall soon see it grow quickly.", "Can I take more care of it?"]
["Indeed, I think of nothing else but the tulip.", "\"Of nothing else, Rosa?"]
["Then, turning again to Rosa, he continued his questions.", "\"Is the oval regular?", "the cylinder full?"]
["cried Cornelius.", "\"Is the involucrum open?"]
["Yes,\" answered Rosa, \"one may already distinguish a thread of different colour, as thin as a hair.", "And its colour?"]
["Oh,\" answered Rosa, \"it is very dark!", "Brown?"]
["\"Darker, my good Rosa, darker?"]
["she said.", "Enough?"]
["Oh, if you have three hundred guilders, you must not send a messenger, Rosa, but you must go to Haarlem yourself.", "But what in the meantime is to become of the flower?"]
["how wicked men are!", "What have I done to offend them, and why have they deprived me of my liberty?"]
["I shall do better than that.", "What will you do?"]
["Rosa, no doubt, would be watching too, but, happier than he, she watched over the tulip; she had before her eyes that noble flower, that wonder of wonders, which not only was unknown, but was not even thought possible until then.", "What would the world say when it heard that the black tulip was found, that it existed and that it was the prisoner Van Baerle who had found it?"]
["Night came, and with it Rosa, joyous and cheerful as a bird.", "Well?"]
["This night, without any doubt, our tulip will be in flower.\"", "And will it flower black?"]
["my dear Rosa, I have been dreaming all night, in the first place of you,\" (Rosa made a sign of incredulity,) \"and then of what we must do.\"", "Well?"]
["If it is no more than that, I have a messenger quite ready.", "Is he safe?"]
["Be quiet,\" said Rosa, smiling, \"he is still under age, as you have yourself fixed it from twenty-six to twenty-eight.", "In fine, do you think you may rely on this young man?"]
["You will write to the President of the Horticultural Society, and I am sure he will come.\"", "But if he tarries?"]
["Oh!", "\"Did you not tell me yourself of what you apprehended from your lover Jacob?"]
["I shall watch; be quiet.", "But if it opened whilst you were here?"]
["And if on your return you find it open?", "Well?"]
["I only lack one thing, Rosa.\"", "And that is?"]
["\"It is written, my dearest Cornelius,\" said Rosa.", "Is it, indeed?"]
["the messenger!\"", "What's the name of the President?"]
["This happened during those seven days which made Cornelius so unhappy, depriving him at the same time of all news of Rosa and of his tulip.", "Would the coolness between Rosa and Cornelius last for ever?"]
["He did not doubt that this was the black tulip which was in flower.", "But what was she going to do with it?", "Would she set out that instant to Haarlem with it?"]
["Was she only going to show the tulip to Cornelius?"]
["the tulip----\" \"Well?\"", "How shall I tell you?"]
["Some one has taken--stolen it from us.", "Stolen--taken?"]
["The key was never out of my hands; I clinched it as if I were afraid it would take wings.\"", "But how did it happen, then?"]
["O Cornelius, forgive me, forgive me, it will kill me!", "Seeing Rosa's distress, Cornelius seized the iron bars of the grating, and furiously shaking them, called out,-- \"Rosa, Rosa, we have been robbed, it is true, but shall we allow ourselves to be dejected for all that?"]
["\"But I say that it is no one else but that infamous Jacob.", "Shall we allow him to carry to Haarlem the fruit of our labour, the fruit of our sleepless nights, the child of our love?"]
["\"But how can we do all this, my friend, without letting my father know we were in communication with each other?"]
["Alas!", "cried Rosa, sobbing, \"can I open the door for you?", "have I the keys?"]
["Rosa, in her fright, made vain attempts to check this furious outbreak.", "I tell you that I shall kill that infamous Gryphus?"]
["He rudely seized his daughter by the wrist.", "So you will take my keys?"]
["And you have my daughter for an accomplice.", "Am I, forsooth, in a den of thieves,--in a cave of brigands?"]
["Yes, sir,\" answered Rosa; \"I come at least to speak of it.", "Is it doing well, then?"]
["sir, I don't know,\" said Rosa.", "\"How is that?"]
["A very great one, sir; yet not to it, but to me.", "What?"]
["Yes, sir.", "Do you know the thief?"]
["How is that?"]
["Why not?"]
["As I see you, miss.", "But where?"]
["With my master?", "Yes, are you not in the service of Master Isaac Boxtel?", "I?"]
["But for whom do you take me, sir?", "And for whom do you take me?"]
["And what is it you told me just now?"]
["I repeat to you, sir, that I do not know who this Mynheer Boxtel is, and that I have now heard his name pronounced for the first time.", "You do not know who Mynheer Boxtel is, and you also had a black tulip?", "But is there any other besides mine?"]
["Yes,--that of Mynheer Boxtel.", "How is it?"]
["Without speck?"]
["And you have this tulip,--you have it deposited here?"]
["cried Rosa, \"this Boxtel--this Isaac Boxtel--who calls himself the owner of the black tulip----\" \"And who is its owner?\"", "Is he not a very thin man?", "Bald?"]
["With sunken eyes?"]
["Restless, stooping, and bowlegged?"]
["\"And the tulip, sir?"]
["\"What!", "you are here to claim the tulip of Master Boxtel?"]
["Honoured sir,\" a little put out by this apostrophe, \"I do not say that I am coming to claim the tulip of Master Boxtel, but to reclaim my own.", "Yours?"]
["She reflected for a moment.", "On the other hand, if I recognise this Boxtel as Jacob, who knows what will come out of it?"]
["\"Well, I declare, here is a proposal,\" said Van Systens.", "What do you mean?", "I ask you what can be proved by your recognising them?", "After all,\" said Rosa, in her despair, \"you are an honest man, sir; how would you feel if one day you found out that you had given the prize to a man for something which he not only had not produced, but which he had even stolen?"]
["What is this?", "cried the burgomaster; \"what is this?", "Is it possible?"]
["said Van Systens, \"what glory to the society if its endeavours are pleasing to your Highness!\"", "Have you got the flower here?"]
["I am sorry to say we have not.", "And where is it?"]
["Who is he?"]
["His name?"]
["His quarters?"]
["Very well, send for him.", "Yes, your Highness, but----\" \"What is it?"]
["Well, then, Monseigneur, if it must be said, a little difficulty has presented itself.", "What difficulty?"]
["So it is, your Highness.", "And have you any proofs of their guilt?", "No, Monseigneur, the guilty woman----\" \"The guilty woman, Sir?"]
["And what do you think of her?"]
["And so she claims the tulip?"]
["And what proof does she offer?"]
["What am I to tell you, sir,\" said Rosa, \"beside that which I have told you already.", "Well, then, what is it?"]
["Which?"]
["If I do not recognise it as mine I will frankly tell it; but if I do recognise it I will reclaim it, even if I go before his Highness the Stadtholder himself, with my proofs in my hands.\"", "You have, then, some proofs, my child?"]
["With the very simple fact of my having planted and grown it in my own chamber.", "\"In your chamber?"]
["At Loewestein.", "You are from Loewestein?"]
["And, all the while feigning to be engaged with his book, he watched Rosa with even more attention than he had before.", "And you are fond of flowers?"]
["Yes, sir.", "Then you are an experienced florist, I dare say?"]
["No, the black tulip has not been found by myself.\"", "But by whom else?"]
["By a prisoner of Loewestein?"]
["Rosa opened her large eyes and looked at the stranger, who drew back into the dark corner, as if he wished to escape her observation.", "Why, sir?"]
["But Boxtel, making a violent effort to control his feelings, was already himself again.", "Master Boxtel,\" said William, \"you seem to have discovered the secret of growing the black tulip?"]
["William watched all his movements with evident interest and curiosity.", "Then you don't know this young girl?"]
["No, your Highness!", "And you, child, do you know Master Boxtel?"]
["What do you mean?"]
["What do you say to that, Master Boxtel?"]
["You deny, therefore, having ever been at Loewestein?"]
["\"Now listen to me.", "Do you deny having followed me into the garden, on the day when I prepared the border where I was to plant it?", "Do you deny having followed me into the garden when I pretended to plant it?", "Do you deny that, on that evening, you rushed after my departure to the spot where you hoped to find the bulb?"]
["He is a prisoner of state, who was once condemned to death.\"", "And his name?"]
["Rosa obeyed, as if under mesmeric influence, without having seen the sign.", "It was, then to follow this man that you came to me at Leyden to solicit for the transfer of your father?"]
["William started.", "\"Not guilty of having advised you?"]
["What I wish to say, your Highness, is that Cornelius is as little guilty of the second crime imputed to him as he was of the first.", "\"Of the first?", "And do you know what was his first crime?", "Do you know of what he was accused and convicted?"]
["\"Well, sir, he was ignorant of this correspondence being deposited with him; completely ignorant.", "I am as certain as of my life, that, if it were not so, he would have told me; for how could that pure mind have harboured a secret without revealing it to me?"]
["cried Rosa.", "\"Cornelius a thief?"]
["It is.", "How many bulbs were there of it?"]
["He therefore answered,-- \"Three.\"", "What has become of these bulbs?"]
["what has become of them?"]
["And the third?"]
["The third,--where is it?"]
["\"At home?", "Where?"]
["Boxtel returned to his inn, rather puzzled and uneasy, tormented by misgivings about that paper which William had received from the hand of Rosa, and which his Highness had read, folded up, and so carefully put in his pocket.", "What was the meaning of all this?"]
["Rosa, being watched, was no longer able to come.", "Could she not write?", "and if so, could she convey her letters to him?"]
["He had seen during the two preceding days too much fury and malignity in the eyes of old Gryphus to expect that his vigilance would relax, even for one moment.", "Moreover, had not she to suffer even worse torments than those of seclusion and separation?", "Did this brutal, blaspheming, drunken bully take revenge on his daughter, like the ruthless fathers of the Greek drama?", "And when the Genievre had heated his brain, would it not give to his arm, which had been only too well set by Cornelius, even double force?"]
["It is one of the curses of misfortune that it thus begets doubt.", "Van Baerle had proposed to write to Rosa, but where was she?"]
["But how should he write?"]
["He was one of those choice spirits who abhor everything that is common, and who often lose a good chance through not taking the way of the vulgar, that high road of mediocrity which leads to everything.", "\"How is it possible,\" said Cornelius to himself, \"that I should escape from Loewestein, as Grotius has done the same thing before me?", "Has not every precaution been taken since?", "Are not the windows barred?", "Are not the doors of double and even of treble strength, and the sentinels ten times more watchful?", "And have not I, besides all this, an Argus so much the more dangerous as he has the keen eyes of hatred?", "Finally, is there not one fact which takes away all my spirit, I mean Rosa's absence?", "But suppose I should waste ten years of my life in making a file to file off my bars, or in braiding cords to let myself down from the window, or in sticking wings on my shoulders to fly, like Daedalus?"]
["Well, I shall get at the throat of that old villain, and strangle him.\"", "Cornelius at these words stopped for a moment, biting his lips and staring out before him; then, eagerly returning to an idea which seemed to possess a strange fascination for him, he continued,-- \"Well, and once having strangled him, why should I not take his keys from him, why not go down the stairs as if I had done the most virtuous action, why not go and fetch Rosa from her room, why not tell her all, and jump from her window into the Waal?"]
["Gryphus went up to the prisoner and said,-- \"But you don't see that I have taken means to get you under, and to force you to confess your crimes.\"", "Are you mad, my dear Master Gryphus?"]
["\"Yes, indeed, I threaten you,\" cried the jailer.", "And with what?"]
["I wish you may.", "Don't you see my hand is empty?"]
["But that's not a punishment to me; I eat only bread, and the worse the bread is to your taste, the better it is to mine.\"", "How so?"]
["\"Well, well, well,\" answered Gryphus.", "But if a sorcerer can change black bread into white, won't he die of hunger if he has no bread at all?", "What's that?"]
["Cornelius put on a smiling face again, and said,-- \"Have you not seen me make the pigeons come here from Dort?\"", "Well?"]
["Well, a pigeon is a very dainty morsel, and a man who eats one every day would not starve, I think.", "And how about the fire?"]
["but you know that I'm in league with the devil.", "Do you think the devil will leave me without fire?"]
["I'll tell you what I want,\" answered Gryphus; \"I want you to restore to me my daughter Rosa.", "Your daughter?"]
["Now, will you tell me where she is?\"", "Rosa is not at Loewestein?"]
["I see,\" said Cornelius, \"this is a trap you are laying for me.", "Now, for the last time, will you tell me where my daughter is?"]
["\"Only wait, only wait,\" growled Gryphus, white with rage, and with quivering lips, as his brain began to turn.", "\"Ah, you will not tell me anything?"]
["He advanced a step towards Cornelius, and said, showing him the weapon which he held in his hands,-- \"Do you see this knife?", "But, you blockhead,\" said Cornelius, \"will you really kill me?"]
["\"Yes, Captain,\" answered a non-commissioned officer.", "Then this is the cell of the prisoner Cornelius van Baerle?"]
["Where is the prisoner?"]
["You are Dr. Cornelius van Baerle?"]
["A lie.", "How so?"]
["How Gryphus would glory in his punishment!", "Punishment?"]
["But Rosa, poor girl!", "must he die without a glimpse of her, without an opportunity to give her one last kiss, or even to say one last word of farewell?", "And, worst of all, must he die without any intelligence of the black tulip, and regain his consciousness in heaven with no idea in what direction he should look to find it?"]
["But, sir, it was only in self-defence.", "Never mind,\" said the Captain, shrugging his shoulders like a true philosopher, \"let him talk; what does it matter to you now?"]
["The unfortunate tulip-fancier then felt that he had no more resources, and no more friends, and resigned himself to his fate.", "God's will be done,\" he muttered, bowing his head; then, turning towards the officer, who seemed complacently to wait until he had finished his meditations he asked,-- \"Please, sir, tell me now, where am I to go?"]
["\"Monseigneur,\" she stammered.", "You have a father at Loewestein?"]
["You do not love him?"]
["Rosa cast her eyes to the ground.", "What is the reason of your not loving your father?"]
["In what way does he show his wickedness?"]
["All of them?"]
["But don't you bear him a grudge for ill-treating some one in particular?", "My father ill-treats in particular Mynheer van Baerle, who----\" \"Who is your lover?"]
["\"Whom I love, Monseigneur,\" she answered proudly.", "Since when?"]
["Since the day when I first saw him.", "And when was that?"]
["After a momentary silence, he resumed the conversation.", "But to what can it lead to love a man who is doomed to live and die in prison?"]
["And would you accept the lot of being the wife of a prisoner?"]
["There is something like hope in your tone; what do you hope?"]

["To-day is no time for sloth; I must act.\"", "Monsieur--\" I began, but he broke in on me: \"Nom de dieu, F\u00e9lix, are we to sit idle while mademoiselle is carried off by that beast Lucas?"]
["\"To take the moon in my teeth,\" he cried.", "Yes, monsieur, but how?"]
["He flung away and made a turn down the room, and came back to seize me by the arm.", "How are we to do it, F\u00e9lix?"]
["Not of Monsieur, or you, or Vigo.\"", "And of Mayenne?"]
["He said he would, and he did.\"", "Think you he meant to let you go from the first?", "Who knows?"]
["\"Oh, you look very smiling over it,\" he cried.", "Think you I like sneaking back home again like a whipped hound to his kennel?"]
["But even at that, I think I should not go if it were not for mademoiselle.\"", "You will beg his aid, monsieur?"]
["I think he was half sorry, half glad.", "Where's Vigo?"]
["But he could not tell.\"", "Have you sent to tell him about me?"]
["Vigo made no answer, but the corners of his grim mouth twitched.", "\"That's no news, either?"]
["But at the end of the adventure all the comment he made was: \"A fool for luck.\"", "\"Well,\" said M. \u00c9tienne, impatiently, \"is that all you have to say?"]
["\"Do?"]
["Nothing?"]
["\"Nothing?"]
["Some day you will surely get a chance to fight Lucas, monsieur.", "And meantime he is to enjoy her?"]
["\"But there is Mayenne.", "Can we storm the H\u00f4tel de Lorraine?"]
["You have a sword and a good cause to draw it in.", "What more should a man ask in the world than that?"]
["Mayenne will have you killed and flung into the Seine, as easy as eat breakfast.\"", "\"And you bid me grudge my life?"]
["Monsieur opposed the marriage as long as Mayenne desired it; but now that Mayenne forbids it, stealing the demoiselle is another pair of sleeves.", "\"Well, then,\" cried M. \u00c9tienne, all good humour in a moment, \"what more do you want?"]
["No one would obey with a readier heart than I. Mordieu, monsieur, I have no objection to succouring a damsel in distress; I have been in the business before now.\"", "\"Then why not now?"]
["My lord was white with ire.", "Who is master here, you or I?"]
["\"This is a pretty way to keep an inn,\" I thought.", "Where have all the lazy rascals got to?"]
["Ah--\" The breath failed him utterly, but his eyes, bloodshot and bulging, rolled toward me.", "What now?"]
["Who are you?"]
["\"I came to pay a bill--\" \"His servant,\" Ma\u00eetre Menard contrived to murmur, the dragoon allowing him a breath.", "\"Oh, you are the Comte de Mar's servant, are you?"]
["What do you want of him?"]
["But I have the governor's warrant for his arrest.\"", "On what charge?"]
["But I know he will be back here to supper.\"", "\"Oh, you don't know, don't you?"]
["Then the blur lifted, and my amazed eyes beheld not my master, but--Lucas!", "How now, sirrah?"]
["I regret to inconvenience monsieur,\" the captain answered, \"but he is wanted at the Bastille.", "\"Wanted?"]
["I have the warrant for your arrest from M. de Belin.\"", "At whose instigation?", "\"How should I know'?"]
["I am not the Comte de Mar!\"", "\"Oh, you say that now, do you?"]
["I am Paul de Lorraine, nephew to my Lord Mayenne.\"", "Why don't you say straight out that you're the Duc de Guise?"]
["The Duke of Guise's eldest brother is but seventeen--\" \"I did not say I was legitimate.", "\"Oh, you did not say that?"]
["Speak up, you old turnspit,\" he shouted to Ma\u00eetre Menard.", "Am I he?"]
["\"Speak, rascal,\" Lucas cried.", "Am I Comte de Mar?"]
["He is not the Comte de Mar.\"", "Who is he, then?"]
["His first fright had given way to fury at perceiving himself the victim of a mistake, but now alarm was born in his eyes again.", "Was it, after all, a mistake?"]
["\"I have no orders to take you to M. de Belin,\" he returned calmly.", "\"So you wrote the description, did you?"]
["The captain went on reading from his little paper: [Illustration: \"HE WAS DEPOSITED IN THE BIG BLACK COACH.\"]", "'Fair hair, gray eyes, aquiline nose'--I suppose you will still tell us, monsieur, that you are not the man?"]
["The next moment the soldier had twisted a handkerchief about his mouth.", "Ready?"]
["At any rate, there was the bandage; that was enough to satisfy the captain.\"", "And they took him off?"]
["They gagged him because he protested so much, and lugged him off.\"", "To the Bastille?"]
["Then I send you off on a stupid errand, and see what you get into!\"", "Monsieur, I put it to you: Had you been there, how could Lucas have been arrested for Comte de Mar?"]
["She used to contrive to be in her chamber after supper.\"", "But, monsieur, how long is it since you were there last?"]
["This I say, her eyes are blue._ He stopped again and stood gazing up into the window, but whether he saw something or heard something I could not tell.", "Apparently he was not sure himself, for presently, a little tremulous, he added the four verses: _Askest thou of me a clue To that lady I love best?"]
["Ferou.\"", "Of the Sixteen?"]
["There was a whirring of wings about us, and a squeaking; once something swooped square into my face, knocking a cry of terror from me, and a laugh from him.", "\"What was it?", "a bat?"]
["We could make nothing of him, save that he was a large man, soberly clad.", "Who is it?"]
["Is it you, Ferou?"]
["And for the minute the place was no longer dark; I saw more lightning than even flashed in the Rue Coupejarrets.", "Are you hurt, F\u00e9lix?"]
["The man took up his candle to light us to the door.", "Perhaps it would not trouble monsieur to say a word for me over there?"]
["I shall certainly bring the matter up at the next sitting.\"", "Monsieur is a member of the Parliament?"]
["\"I have that honour, monsieur,\" the little man replied, delighted to impress us, as he himself was impressed, by the sense of his importance.", "Oh,\" said M. \u00c9tienne, with increasing solemnity, \"perhaps monsieur had a hand in a certain decree of the 28th June?"]
["I am Pierre Marceau!\"", "\"Oh, you are Pierre Marceau?"]
["As I was saying, M. Marceau, your decree is most offensive to the general-duke, and therefore, since he is my particular enemy, most pleasing to me.", "A beautiful night, is it not, sir?"]
["The unknown made a rapid step toward me, crying, \"What--\" But at the word M. \u00c9tienne emerged from the shadows.", "Who lives?"]
["You, F\u00e9lix?"]
["My cousin Grammont--who is dead--was in the plot, and his lackey Pontou, and Martin the clerk; but the contriver was Lucas.", "Lucas?"]
["He is Mayenne's henchman, son to Guise himself.\"", "And how long have you known this?"]
["I sprang up, and Monsieur, my duke, embraced me.", "Lucky we came up the lane when we did, eh, F\u00e9lix?"]
["That was why I tried.\"", "Monsieur,\" I cried, curiosity mastering me, \"was she in the window?"]
["Monsieur looked over his shoulder with a sudden anxiety.", "F\u00e9lix, you said Huguet had run for aid?"]
["Five, I think.\"", "Now, Monsieur, how came you to be in this place in the dark?", "\"Why, what to do, \u00c9tienne?"]
["I could not leave St. Denis earlier, and night is my time to enter Paris.", "The inns were shut--\" \"But some friend near the gate?"]
["\"This is Bernet le Borgne,\" he said.", "\"Have you encountered him before, Monsieur?"]
["And one of those who fled last came upon him helpless and did this.", "Why didn't I follow him instead of sitting down, a John o'dreams?"]
["But of a sudden he turned back to us, laying quick fingers on the poor torn breast.", "What is it, Monsieur?"]
["But no papers revealed themselves.", "What were they, Monsieur?"]
["We'll get them back.\"", "\"When?"]
["\"What!", "the king's seal?"]
["Expect, then, Monsieur, to see the papers in an hour's time.\"", "\u00c9tienne, \u00c9tienne,\" Monsieur cried, \"are you mad?"]
["My stomach was beginning to remind me that I had given it nothing for twelve hours or so, while I had worked my legs hard.", "Does M. Bernet lodge with you?"]
["We were his only patrons at the moment.", "\"M. Bernet?"]
["I but rent the ground floor for my purposes.\"", "But M. Bernet lodges in the house, then?"]
["He lodges round the corner, in the court off the Rue Clichet.\"", "But he comes here often?"]
["M. \u00c9tienne laid down the drink-money, and something more.", "Sometimes he has a friend with him, eh?"]
["But he goes elsewhere for his friends.\"", "Then you can tell us, my man, where he lodges?"]
["\"Third story back,\" he said.", "Does M. Bernet lodge alone?"]
["Aye, I suppose so,\" the old chap grinned, \"when monsieur walks in.", "But he has another friend besides me, has he not?"]
["The one he went out with.\"", "And what sort of person was this?", "\"Nay, how was I to see?"]
["Those second-floor people are not so tidy as they might be; one stumbles over all sorts of their rubbish out in the public way.\"", "The door in front of us opened with a startling suddenness, and a big, brawny wench bounced out to demand of us: \"What is that she says?"]
["The old carl, though his sweeping was done, leaned on his broom on the outer step.", "\"So you didn't find M. Bernet at home?"]
["I would have kicked the old curmudgeon, but M. \u00c9tienne drew two gold pieces from his pouch.", "Perchance if I ask you civilly, you will tell me with whom M. Bernet went out last night?", "Who says he went out with anybody?"]
["Well, Lord knows if it is really his, but he goes by the name of Peyrot.", "And where does he lodge?", "\"How should I know?"]
["\"Well, Rue des Tournelles, sign of the Gilded Shears,\" the old carl spat out at last.", "You are sure?"]
["M. \u00c9tienne stood still, his hand on the door-knob, eager, hesitating.", "Here was the man; were the papers here?", "If they were, should we secure them?"]
["M. \u00c9tienne called out softly: \"Peyrot!\"", "Who is it?"]
["Who are you, then?"]
["I want to speak with you about the affair of to-night.", "What affair?"]
["\"To-night?"]
["If you want me to shout it out on your stairs, the St. Quentin affair.", "Now, what may you mean by that?"]
["He grinned at me in open enjoyment.", "Monsieur desired?"]
["I thought it was because he had not yet made up his mind what line to take; but had I viewed him with neutral eyes I might easily have deemed his bewilderment genuine.", "Perhaps we should get on better if I could understand what monsieur is driving at?"]
["We know as well as you where you were before dawn.\"", "\"Before dawn?"]
["M. \u00c9tienne sat down on the chest and smiled more amiably than ever.", "Why--have I never known you before, Peyrot?"]
["\"Now are we more comfortable,\" Peyrot observed, pulling a chair over against the wall and seating him, the pistol on his knee.", "Monsieur was saying?"]
["You are from Guienne, methinks.\"", "Then memory bringing a deep twinkle to his eye, he added: \"What think you, monsieur?"]
["M. \u00c9tienne rose and leaned across the table toward him.", "\"M. Peyrot has made his fortune in Paris?"]
["Peyrot shrugged his shoulders, his eyes leaving the ceiling and making a mocking pilgrimage of the room, resting finally on his own rusty clothing.", "Do I look it?"]
["If he had it, it were a crying shame to pay out honest money for what we might take by force; to buy your own goods from a thief were a sin.", "But supposing he had it not?", "If we could seize upon him, disarm him, bind him, threaten him, beat him, rack him, would he--granted he knew--reveal its whereabouts?"]
["You may do as you like about appearing; I shall be there with my fifty pistoles.\"", "What guaranty have I that you will deal fairly with me?"]
["\"Yes, we could not have done otherwise, M. \u00c9tienne.", "But, monsieur, will you dare go to this inn?"]
["I go home now for the ransom, and I will e'en be at the pains to doff this gear for something darker.", "\"Monsieur,\" I pleaded, \"why not stay at home to get your dues of sleep?"]
["Keep your safe distance and dog him if you can.\"", "And if I lose him?"]
["Peyrot sprang forward to detain us.", "\"Monsieur, will you not dine with me?"]
["My faith, you've made a night of it!\"", "\"Won't you take me for your messenger, Monsieur?"]
["The credit of the rescue was none of mine; no more was the blame of failure.", "I need not rack myself with questioning, Had I in this or that done differently, should I not have triumphed?"]
["He, meeting my eye, smiled in the friendliest way, like a child, and said, in Italian: \"Good day to you, my little gentleman.\"", "I had still the uncertain feeling that I must be in a dream, for why should an Italian jeweller be displaying his treasures to me, a penniless page?"]
["He looked somewhat surprised and more than pleased, breaking at once into voluble speech: \"The best of greetings to you, young sir.", "Now, what can I sell you this fine day?"]
["At once he abandoned the subject, seeing that he was making naught by it.", "The messer is very much occupied?"]
["\"The messer has no leisure for trifling in boudoirs; he is occupied with great matters?"]
["\"The messer must often be engaged in great risks, in perilous encounters.", "Is it not so?"]
["Oh, there's nobody like him,\" I answered, \"except, of course, M. le Duc.", "Ah, then you have two masters?"]
["\"This is the house of the Duke of St. Quentin,\" I said.", "Surely you could not come in at the gate without discovering that?", "He is a very grand seigneur, then, this duke?"]
["More of a man than the Comte de Mar?"]
["About this cross, now--\" \"Oh, yes,\" he answered at once, accepting with willingness--well feigned, I thought--the change of topic.", "\"You can give me ten pistoles, say you?"]
["\"Yes,\" I said, without enthusiasm.", "He has always treated you well?"]
["I have only known him two days.\"", "\"But you have known him well?"]
["I have seen really very little of him.\"", "And you know not whether or no he be a good master?"]
["I said.", "And so you know not you little villain, whether you have a good master or not?", "But how was I to dream it was monsieur?"]
["And Peyrot fooled us, and I didn't want to be fooled again.\"", "Then I am a good master?"]
["He had had his back to the window at first, and I had not noted them; but now that he had turned, his eyes gleamed so light as to be fairly startling in his dark face--like stars in a stormy sky.", "Well, then, how do you like me?"]
["For if I look new to you, I think I may look so to the H\u00f4tel de Lorraine.", "Monsieur goes to the H\u00f4tel de Lorraine as a jeweller?"]
["Monsieur!", "\"Why, look you, F\u00e9lix,\" he laughed, \"how else am I to take you?"]
["I put one of his gossip's shoes on the floor beside my foot.", "Now, monsieur, I ask you, how am I to get into that?", "Shall I fetch you Vigo's?"]
["The generous meat and wine put new heart into me; by the time my lord returned I was eager for the enterprise.", "Have you finished?"]
["I have the hope that the ladies will heed me and my jewels more than you.\"", "Monsieur, could we not go safelier at night?"]
["\"Nom d'un chien!", "What's all this?"]
["the man shouted at us, to make us understand the better.", "Haven't you a word of honest French in your head?"]
["\"I,\" answered Pierre himself.", "Now, what may your errand be?"]
["\"But I am a stranger here,\" M. \u00c9tienne explained.", "\"Did I hire a porter, how am I to tell an honest one?", "Belike he might run off with all my treasures, and where is poor Giovanni then?"]
["He sat down on the bench by M. \u00c9tienne.", "How came you two to be in Paris?"]
["He sprang to his feet, drawing his dagger.", "Who insults my sister?"]
["If you will take her about--\" \"Madame says the jeweller fellow is to come up,\" our messenger announced, returning.", "My lord besought Pierre: \"My knife?", "I may have my knife?"]
["But I was somewhat doubtful of my skill to find it through the winding corridors of a great palace.", "I was more than likely to meet some one who would question my purpose, and what answer could I make?"]
["Yet here were the golden moments flying and our cause no further advanced.", "Should I leave it all to M. \u00c9tienne, trusting that when he had made his sales here he would be permitted to seek out the other ladies of the house?", "Or should I strive to aid him?"]
["He made a step forward; I thought him about to catch her in his arms, when he recollected himself and dropped on his knees to grope for the fallen trinket.", "You wanted me, madame?"]
["\"Your charge is as false, madame, as your wish is cruel.", "Do you go to vespers and come home to say such things?"]
["He turned on me with an impatient frown, but before he could answer, Mme.", "de Montpensier cried, with a laugh: \"And do you fear the dark, wench?"]
["If we linger, we may be robbed in the dark streets.\"", "Why, my sister, where are your manners?"]
["\"She said I should kiss you--\" I put my fingers in my ears and then took them out again, for if my ears were sealed, how was I to hear Mme.", "de Nemours approaching?"]
["This is madness!", "You must go!\"", "Are you sorry I came?"]
["Are you sorry, Lorance?"]
["His mother--merciful angel--let me through.\"", "And you were not hurt?"]
["\"But the wound before?"]
["I was dizzy; I could not walk.", "\"But now, monsieur?"]
["I am of his blood, and dwell in his house, and eat at his board.\"", "Are you afraid?"]
["\"Are you frightened, heart-root of mine?"]
["\"It is not that,\" she answered.", "Am I your fear?"]
["He raised his eyes to hers, still kneeling at her feet.", "Lorance, will you come with me?"]
["What, monsieur!", "sent to arrest you?"]
["Here in Paris you may not draw a tranquil breath.\"", "\"And shall I flee my dangers?"]
["\"Aye, but she does not wed the enemy of her own.", "Monsieur, you are full of loyalty; shall I have none?"]
["M. \u00c9tienne smiled his eager, deprecating smile, informing his Highness that we, poor creatures, spoke no French.", "How came you in Paris, then?"]
["The close kinship of these men betrayed itself in nothing so sharply as in their unerring instinct for annoying each other.", "Had Lucas volunteered explanation for his absence, Mayenne would not have listened to it; but as he withheld it, the duke demanded brusquely: \"Well, do you give an account of yourself?"]
["He looked with raised eyebrows toward us.", "You would not have me speak before these vermin, uncle?"]
["But at length he did begin it: \"I went to Belin to inform him that day before yesterday \u00c9tienne de Mar murdered his lackey, Pontou, in Mar's house in the Rue Coupejarrets.\"", "Was that your errand?"]
["Lucas started forward sharply.", "Do you tell me you did not know my purpose?"]
["It's enough to make me sign papers with the devil.\"", "Mar would believe I had broken faith with him?"]
["Lucas cried out: \"When they arrested me my first thought was that this was your work.\"", "In that case, how should you be free now?"]
["Your young friend Mar came to sing under his lady's window.\"", "Saw she him?"]

["Mademoiselle, I take too much joy in your presence to be willing to leave it.", "\"Monsieur,\" she said to the duke, ignoring her cousin Paul with a coolness that must have maddened him, \"will you not dismiss your tradespeople?"]
["She uttered a little gasp, but scarce of surprise--almost of relief that the blow, so long expected, had at last been dealt.", "You will marry me, monsieur?"]
["To M. de Brie?"]
["Mayenne, heeding him no more than if he had not been there, rose and went to Mlle de Montluc.", "Have I your obedience, cousin?"]
["While I picked it up and endeavoured with clumsy fingers to put it on properly, he set on its legs the stool I had flung down, threw the pieces of Lucas's sword into the fireplace, seized his box, dashed to me and set my wig straight, dashed to the outer door, and opened it just as Pierre came up the corridor.", "Well, what do you want?"]
["They've taken him off in a coach to the Bastille.\"", "Who have?"]

["No good in that; no use fighting four regiments.", "What the devil are they arresting him for, F\u00e9lix?"]

["For me?"]
["Denis.\"", "You must take me there to-night.", "I was going,\" I stammered, bewildered; \"but you, mademoiselle--\" \"You knew of M. de Mar's arrest?"]
["What coil is this, F\u00e9lix?"]
["\"You are Vigo,\" she said at once.", "Yes; and I know not what noble lady mademoiselle can be, save--will it please her to come into the house?"]
["Denis.\"", "To-morrow?"]
["She sprang to her feet, dry-eyed, fierce as a young lioness.", "\"Is that all you can say?"]
["Vigo took her hand and kissed it.", "\"Shall we start, Vigo?"]
["I stood on the house-steps with mademoiselle, while he took aside Squinting Charlot for a low-voiced, emphatic interview.", "Must we wait?"]

["It was the same window where I had stood when Grammont seized me.", "Would it be possible to jump and catch the sill?"]
["My lord's voice was as unsteady as mine.", "But the ladder?"]
["I said, getting to my feet.", "\"But the men, monsieur?"]
["\u00c9tienne.\"", "Have you horse for us, Vigo?"]
["I suppose we're leaving Paris to buy you out of the Bastille?\"", "Not worth it, eh, Vigo?"]
["You are to go straight to the king.\"", "I may go to M. de St. Quentin's lodgings first?"]
["Scarlet under the lash, M. \u00c9tienne, kneeling, bent his eyes on the ground.", "\"Misfortune, sirrah?", "Misfortune you call it?"]
["M. \u00c9tienne stared up from the writing into the king's laughing face.", "\"I, Sire?"]
["They stood before each other, neither touching nor speaking, but only looking one at the other like two blind folk by a heavenly miracle restored to sight.", "\"How now, children?", "Am I not a model monarch?", "Do you swear by me forever?"]
["Everything looked smiling and beautiful, and there was an almost irresistible contagion in the mirth of her young cousin, but still she could not help feeling sad.", "It was not merely that she would have to part with Eric, \"but that bright boy,\" thought Fanny, \"what will become of him?"]
["Only hearing that he was to do something, too frightened to ask what it was, and feeling sure that even if he did, he should not make out what the master meant, Eric ran out, went straight to Mr Lawley's house, and, after having managed by strenuous jumps to touch the knocker, informed the servant \"that Mr Lawley wanted his man.\"", "What man?", "said the maid-servant, \"the young man?", "or the butler?"]
["all Eric knew was, that he was in the habit of sending sometimes for one or other of these functionaries; but he was in for it, so with a faltering voice he said \"the young man\" at hazard, and went back to the Latin-school.", "Why have you been so long?"]
["In another moment Eric had been folded to his father's heart, and locked in the arms of his little brother Vernon.", "Who shall describe the emotions of those few moments?"]
["Yes, my boy, and God loves to hear them.", "Aren't there some who never say prayers, mother?"]
["He glanced first at the note, and then looked full at the boy, as though determined to read his whole character by a single perusal of his face.", "Williams, I suppose?"]
["Eric--I mean Williams.", "Then why don't you say what you mean?"]
["Eric, gulping down his fury with a great effort, turned to his opponent, and said coolly, \"Is that what you always do to new fellows?\"", "Yes, you bumptious young owl, it is, and that too;\" and a tolerably smart slap on the face followed--leaving a red mark on a cheek already aflame with anger and indignation,--\"should you like a little more?"]
["What's that for?"]
["I did nothing of the kind, and you know it as well as I do.", "\"What?", "I'm a liar, am I?"]
["But at this instant some boys hearing the quarrel ran up, and Russell among them.", "Hallo, Barker,\" said one; \"what's up?"]
["Why couldn't you let him alone for the first day at any rate?\"", "\"What's that to you?"]
["whispered half a dozen voices, and instantly the knot of boys dispersed in every direction, as Mr Gordon was seen approaching.", "fighting already?"]
["it seems both boys and masters are against me,\" and very disconsolately he walked to pick up his cap.", "The boys were all dispersed on the playground at different games, and as he went home he was stopped perpetually, and had to answer the usual questions, \"What's your name?", "Are you a boarder or a day scholar?"]
["_Wordsworth_.", "Why is it that new boys are almost invariably ill-treated?"]
["In his bright joyous life at Fairholm, in the little he saw of the boys at the Latin-school, he had met with nothing but kindness and caresses, and the generous nobleness of his character had seemed to claim them as a natural element.", "And now, why,\" he asked impatiently, \"should this bulldog sort of fellow have set his whole aim to annoy, vex, and hurt me?"]
["He bore for a time, until he felt that he _must_ have the justice and defence, without which it would have been impossible for him to continue at Roslyn School.", "But why, you ask, didn't he tell the monitors?"]
["And, above all, he acted invariably from the highest principle; he presented that noblest of all noble spectacles--one so rare that many think it impossible--the spectacle of an honourable, pure-hearted, happy boy, who, as his early years speed by, is ever growing in wisdom and stature, and favour with God and man.", "Did that brute Barker ever bully you as he bullies me?"]
["I slept in his dormitory when I first came, and he has often made me so wretched that I have flung myself on my knees at night in pretence of prayer, but really to get a little quiet time to cry like a child.", "And when was it he left off at last?"]
["Besides, Duncan, Montagu, and other friends of mine, began to cut him in consequence, so he thought it best to leave off.\"", "How is it, Russell, that fellows stand by and let him do it?"]
["\"Barker, I'll never speak to you again from this day,\" said Montagu, turning on his heel, with a look of withering contempt.", "\"What do I care?"]
["On this occasion, just as Graham, the last boy on the form in front, handed Eric the crib, Mr Gordon happened to look up, and Eric, very naturally anxious to screen another from trouble, popped the book under his own Homer.", "Williams, what are you doing?"]
["It isn't mine, sir.", "Then whose is it?"]
["I don't mind the pain; but I shan't like him any more, and I'm sure now I shan't get the examination prize.\"", "You don't mean, Eric, that he will be influenced by partiality in the matter?"]
["First, Owen and Williams aequales,\" said he; \"you've got head-remove, you see, in spite of your forebodings, as I always said you would; and I congratulate you with all my heart.", "No?", "said Eric, \"have I really?--you're not joking?"]
["it's not _that_,\" said Russell hastily, as he lifted his swimming eyes to her face.", "What's the matter, Russell?"]
["\"What a capital fellow he is,\" continued Montagu, leaning on his racquet and looking after him, as Russell left the court.", "But I say, Williams, you're not going too, are you?"]
["Why, you know as well as I do that we all write it out by turns.", "Do you mean to say Owen or Russell ever wrote it out?", "Of course not; you wouldn't expect the saints to be guilty of such a thing, would you?"]
["Several boys moved uneasily, and Eric looked nervously round.", "\"Did you hear?"]
["Before Mr Gordon had time to recover from his astonishment, Russell stood by him.", "\"Well, my boy,\" said the master, softening in a moment, and laying his hand gently on Russell's head, \"what have you to say?"]
["Leave me; I feel deeply vexed, and must have time to think over this disgraceful affair.\"", "Oh, Eric,\" he said, \"how came you to write that paper?"]
["Vernon made no reply, but was putting away his sea-anemones with a sigh, when in came Russell to fetch Eric to the cricket.", "\"Well, Verny,\" he said, \"have you been getting those pretty sea-anemones?"]
["\"Mind you take care of them,\" said Russell.", "Where did you find them?", "And have you had a pleasant morning?"]
["The little translucent pools left on the sands by the ebbing tide always swarm with life, and the two boys found great fun in hunting audacious little crabs, or catching the shrimps that shuffled about in the shallow water.", "At last Eric picked up a piece of wood which he found lying on the beach, and said, \"What do you say to coming crab-fishing, Edwin?"]
["Meanwhile our young friends, having caught several crabs, suddenly noticed by the sun that it was getting late.", "\"Good gracious, Edwin,\" said Eric, pulling out his watch, \"it's half-past three; what have we been thinking of?"]
["\"Eric, Eric,\" said Mrs Williams faintly, \"where have you been?"]
["He sat on a low stool, his face buried in his hands, breaking the stillness every now and then with his convulsive sobs.", "\"Oh, Aunty,\" he cried, \"do you think I shall ever see them again?"]
["here you are at last,\" said Duncan, seizing his hand.", "\"How have you enjoyed the holidays?"]
["there's Russell,\" said Eric, springing to the gangway, and warmly shaking his friend's hand as he came on board.", "Have your father and mother gone, Eric?"]
["\"What a shame,\" he said, as it fell on his letter, and made a smudge.", "Who told you to interfere?"]
["\"You'll have to sit it, then,\" said Barker.", "\"Oh, it was you who did it, was it?"]
["He has been making the room intolerable for the last month by his filthy tricks,\" said Eric hotly; \"some one must stop him, and I will somehow, if no one else does.", "\"Who was it, then?", "how was I to know?"]
["He had begun to dislike the latter more and more, and had given him up altogether as one of the reprobates.", "\"A surly...?"]
["He hadn't meant the word to slip out in Russell's hearing, though similar and worse expressions were common enough in his talk with other boys.", "But he didn't like to be reproved, even by Russell, and in the ready spirit of self-defence, he answered-- \"Pooh, Edwin, you don't call that swearing, do you?"]
["Russell was silent.", "\"Besides, what can be the harm of it?"]
["Any two boys talking to each other about Ball would probably profess to like him \"well enough,\" but if they were honest, they would generally end by allowing their contempt.", "We've got a nice set in Number 7, haven't we?"]
["Old Llewellyn's a stunner, and I like Attlay and Graham.\"", "Don't you like Ball, then?"]
["I've often noticed that fellows pretty generally despise him, yet somehow don't like to say so.\"", "Why do you dislike him, Duncan?"]
["But the sense of sin was on Eric's mind.", "How _could_ he speak?", "was not his own language sometimes profane?", "How--how could he profess to reprove another boy on the ground of morality, when he himself said and did things less dangerous perhaps, but equally forbidden?"]
["But I particularly want to speak to you to-day.\"", "In an instant Russell had twined his arm in Eric's as they turned towards Fort Island; and Eric, with an effort, was just going to begin when they heard Montagu's voice calling after them-- \"I say, you fellows, where are you off to?"]
["At last they reached Fort Island, and sate down by the ruined chapel looking on the sea.", "Why, what's the row with you, old boy?"]
["To his surprise Eric's head was still bent, and, at last, he heard a deep suppressed sigh.", "My dear fellow, what is the matter with you?"]
["I knew it must come, Eric,\" said Russell at last, \"and I am so sorry you didn't speak at the time.", "Do the fellows ever talk in that way in either of your dormitories?"]
["It is more than blackguardly, it is deadly,\" answered Russell; \"my father said it was the most fatal curse which could ever become rife in a public school.", "Why do masters never give us any help or advice on these matters?"]
["\"In sermons they do.", "Don't you remember Rowlands's sermon not two weeks ago on Kibroth-Hattaavah?"]
["As soon as Eric had got over his little pique, he made the first advances by writing a note to Upton, which he slipped under his study door, and which ran as follows-- \"Dear Horace,--Don't let us quarrel about nothing.", "Silly fellow, why should you be angry with me because for once I wanted to go a walk with Russell, who, by the bye, is twice as good a fellow as you?"]
["There's to be an awful lark in the dormitories to-night,\" said Eric; \"the Doctor's gone to a dinner-party, and we're going to have no end of fun.", "\"Are you?"]
["After watching a minute or two, he felt sure that there was no danger, and therefore ran up to Upton's study for a change.", "Well, what's up?"]
["A sheet had been pinned from the top of the room, on one side of which stood a boy with a broken dinner-knife, the handle end of which he was pushing through a hole in the middle of the sheet at the shadow of Duncan on the other side.", "The handle towards me now?"]
["At this juncture they heard all the study-boys running downstairs to the library, and, lost in conjecture, retired to their different rooms.", "What do you think he'll do to us?"]
["Eric's cogitations began to be unpleasant, when the door opened, and somebody stole noiselessly in.", "Who's there?"]
["Never saw him in such a rage.\"", "Why, what's he been saying?"]
["Very well, sir, you don't know how to use a study; you shall be deprived of it till the end of term.'\"", "Did he really, Horace?"]
["They displayed all the difference between conscientious and perfunctory work.", "Your exercises _used_ to be far better--even incomparably better,\" said Mr Rose; \"what is the cause of this falling off?"]
["During this conversation, Dr Rowlands came in with Mr Rose.", "He read the paper, frowned, pondered a moment, and then said to Mr Rose-- \"Would you kindly summon the lower-school into the hall?"]
["\"Nothing, sir,\" he murmured in a low tone.", "Nothing whatever?"]
["\"The writing was undoubtedly Williams's,\" suggested some.", "And did you notice how red and pale he got when the Doctor spoke to him, and how he hung his head?"]
["\"I noticed that he stayed in after all the rest last night,\" said Barker pointedly.", "\"Did he?"]
["Has any one charged him with it?"]
["What!", "he said angrily, \"tell a wilful lie to blacken my own innocent character?"]
["I cannot forget how you have been abusing Gordon lately, and though I won't believe you guilty, yet you ought to explain.\"", "\"What?"]
["I needn't tell you that I am quite innocent of this.", "What have I done to be so suspected?"]
["\"I wish you joy of your _friend_, Duncan,\" sneered Barker.", "Friend?"]
["He took Eric's arm kindly as they entered, to show the whole school that he was not ashamed of him, and Eric deeply felt the delicacy of his goodwill.", "\"Are you willing to be tried, Williams,\" asked Avonley, \"on the charge of having written the insulting paper about Mr Gordon?"]
["His appearance caused a little reaction in his favour, and a murmur of applause followed his answer.", "Good,\" said Avonley; \"who will prosecute on the part of the school?"]
["He was a clever fellow, and Eric liked the little he had seen of him.", "\"Have you any objection, Williams, to the jury being composed of the sixth-form?"]
["\"No,\" said Eric, glancing round indifferently.", "Well, now, who will defend the accused?"]
["Thank you, Russell, I _wanted_ you to offer; I could wish no better defender.", "Will Owen, Duncan, and Montagu help me, if they can?"]
["Yes.", "By what means?"]
["Barker was next brought forward, and questioned by Gibson.", "Do you know that Williams is in the habit of using a particular kind of ink?"]
["Could you recognise anything written with it?"]
["Gibson here handed to Barker the paper which had caused so much trouble.", "Is that the kind of ink?"]
["Do you know the handwriting on that paper?"]
["How can you tell?"]
["Yes; Williams has a box of them in his desk.", "Has any other boy, that you are aware of wafers like them?"]
["I have seen him use them.", "For what purpose?"]
["\"Yes,\" said Upton, smiling.", "Have you ever heard him express any opinions of Mr Gordon?"]
["Of what kind?"]
["Have you ever heard him say anything which implied a desire to injure him?"]
["This last fact was new to the school, and excited a great sensation.", "When did he say this?"]
["He brightened up a little when Russell rose to cross-examine him.", "Have you ever known Williams do any mean act?"]
["Do you consider him a boy _likely_ to have been guilty on this occasion?"]
["It is quite true that he dislikes Mr Gordon, and would not object to any open way of showing it; it is quite true that he used the expressions attributed to him, and that the ink and wafers are such as may be found in his desk, and that the handwriting is not unlike his.", "But is it probable that a boy intending to post up an insult such as this, would do so in a manner and at a time so likely to involve him in immediate detection and certain punishment?"]
["At this he affected to be perfectly unconcerned, and merely protested against what he called the meanness of trying to fix the charge on him.", "And what have you been doing the whole of the last day or two,\" asked Gibson quietly, \"but endeavouring to fix the charge on another?"]
["Russell, will you call Graham?"]
["You were in the sick-room on Friday evening?"]
["Did you see any one get in to the schoolroom through the side window?"]
["When he had done this, he got out by the window again, and ran off.\"", "Didn't this strike you as extraordinary?"]
["In about ten minutes he caught up the other two, just as they were getting out of the town.", "What an age you've been, buying a few Easter eggs,\" said Russell, laughing; \"have you been waiting till the hens laid?"]
["O fumose puer!\"", "Well, will you have one?"]
["\"Oh, it's a mere school rule against it.", "How can it be wrong?"]
["Well, clergymen ain't immaculate,\" said he; \"but I have seldom met a man yet who didn't tell you that he was _sorry_ he'd acquired the habit.", "I'm sure you won't thank that rascally cousin of mine for having taught you,\" said Russell; \"but seriously, isn't it a very moping way of spending the afternoon, to go and lie down behind some haystack, or in some frowsy tumble-down barn, as you smokers do, instead of playing racquets or football?"]
["I never saw him so terrific before.\"", "\"You don't mean to say you were convinced it was wrong because Booking was caught, and told lies--do you?"]
["\"`Yes, sir,' said Pietrie, looking unusually crestfallen.", "\"`And don't your parents disapprove it?", "And doesn't it throw you among some of the worst boys, and get you into great troubles?"]
["Now then, you two,\" he shouted; \"no time to lose.", "Will you jump first, Monty?"]
["No, Monty, _you_ can clear it, I've no doubt.\"", "Couldn't we try to swim it together, Edwin?"]
["\"Now's your time,\" shouted Eric again.", "\"What _are_ you waiting for?"]
["Besides, they both saw that a jump was no longer possible; the channel was more than double the width which it had been when Eric leaped, and from the rapid ascent of the rocks on both sides, it was now far out of depth.", "O God, what can we do?"]
["It's our only chance.\"", "What are you going to do?"]
["\"What!", "on this stormy night?"]
["They reached Ellan, and went to the boathouse.", "Have you put out the lifeboat?"]
["At last Russell stirred and groaned.", "Where am I?"]
["Memory had no time to wake, and he screamed and fainted once more.", "Poor Eric knew not what to do but to shelter him to the best of his power; and when he showed any signs of consciousness again, he bent over him, and said, \"Don't you remember, Edwin?"]
["\"How cold it is, and wet too!", "where's Eric?"]
["The nurse shook her head sadly.", "He is very dangerously ill.\" \"Is he?"]
["Eric turned his head to brush away a tear.", "When do you think I shall be allowed to see him?"]
["After a week or two of most anxious suspense, Russell's mind ceased to wander, but the state of his sprain gave more cause for alarm.", "\"Only think, Monty, isn't it hard, isn't it cruel?"]
["Oh, hush, hush!", "he said, as he felt their tears dropping on his hands; \"dear Eric, dear Monty, why should you cry so for me?"]
["He seemed much better, and Eric's spirits were high with the thoughts and hopes of the coming holidays.", "\"There, Edwin,\" he said, as the boy gratefully and eagerly took the flowers, \"don't they make you glad?"]
["One sign was the first sight of the summer steamer going across the bay; another was May eve, when these island-fellows light big gorse fires all over the mountains, and throw yellow marsh-lilies at their doors to keep off the fairies.", "Do you remember, Eddy, gathering some last May eve, and sitting out in the playground till sunset, watching the fires begin to twinkle on Cronck-Irey and Barrule for miles away?"]
["You'll soon be out among us again, that's clear--\" He stopped abruptly: he had been rattling on just in the merry way that Russell now most loved to hear, but, as he was talking, he caught the touch of sadness on Russell's face, and saw his long, abstracted, eager look at the flowers.", "Dear fellow, you're not worse, are you?"]
["\"No, Eric, I shall die.", "There stop, dear fellow, don't cry,\" said he, raising his hands quietly to Eric's face; \"isn't it better for me so?"]
["Yes, remember, I've no home, Eric, and no prospects.", "There was nothing to be sorry for in this, so long as God gave me health and strength; but health went for ever into those waves at the Stack, where you saved my life, dear gallant Eric; and what could I do now?"]
["Eric closed the book reverently, and gazed.", "And now pray for me, Eric, will you?"]
["Yes, he had walked and talked with one of the Holy Ones.", "Had Edwin's death quenched his human affections, and altered his human heart?", "If not, might not he be there even now, leaning over his friend with the beauty of his invisible presence?"]
["Once more the pang of separation entered like iron into his soul.", "Should he ever meet Russell again?", "What if _he_ had died instead of Edwin, where would he have been?"]
["A stone had recently been placed to mark the spot, and they read-- Sacred To The Memory of Edwin Russell An Orphan Boy Died At Roslyn School, May 1847, Aged Fifteen Years.", "_Is it well with the child?"]
["And yet over all his happiness hung a sense of change and half melancholy; they were not changed, but _he_ was changed.", "Can no schoolboy, who reads his history, understand and explain the feeling which I mean?"]
["Do write to me soon, and forgive me, and believe me ever--Your most affectionate, Horace Upton.", "\"P.S.--Is that jolly little Vernon going back to school with you this time?"]
["\"Ha!", "but what is this?"]
["he exclaimed, stamping his foot with anger.", "\"What have I ever done to you young blackguards, that you should treat me thus?", "Have I ever been a bully?", "Have I ever harmed one of you?"]
["Montagu instantly stepped up to him.", "\"You can trust me, sir; may I ask you kindly to say nothing of this?"]
["But it was too late now; the mischief was done.", "\"O Eric,\" said Montagu, \"why did you not make a stand against all this before?"]
["So one evening Duncan said to Eric, \"Do you know little Wildney?\"", "\"You mean that jolly fearless-looking little fellow, with the great black eyes, who came at the beginning of the quarter?"]
["said Duncan; \"you know well enough what I mean; I mean he's not one of your white-faced, lily-hearted new boys, but has lots of fun in him.\"", "Well, what of him?", "Have you any objection to my asking him to sit in the study when he likes?"]
["asked Eric, in surprise.", "\"Don't I, though?"]
["I wish I'd some beer.\"", "Well, why shouldn't we get some?"]
["I'll go with you at once, if you like.\"", "What are you thinking of?"]
["But how will you get out?"]
["Ibant obscuri dubia sub luce.", "Could you get through that?"]
["\"So you're out for a spree,\" he continued, winking in a knowing way.", "Won't you walk into the back parlour while I get them?"]
["\"Stop, I'll pay,\" said Eric.", "What's the damage?"]
["We have a club there which we call `the Anti-muffs,' and that's our smoking-room.\"", "And is that horrid beast the landlord?"]
["Eric came in soon after, and found the little fellow vainly attempting to appear indifferent as he related to his admiring auditors the night's adventure; being evidently rather proud of the \"Eric and I,\" which he introduced every now and then into his story.", "Has he twigged you?"]
["And me?"]
["\"I beg you won't speak of any friend of mine in those terms,\" said Eric, drawing up haughtily.", "I hope you don't call a bad little boy like Wildney, who'd be no credit to any one, _your_ friend, Eric?"]
["shouted Eric, banging the door and flinging into his own study again without further reply.", "Haven't you been a little hard on him, considering the row he's in?"]
["\"Perhaps I have, indeed.", "But who could help it, Owen, in the present state of things?"]
["I'd give them that answer, and no other.", "Why?"]
["How do you mean?"]
["Eric was talking at random, and in the spirit of opposition.", "You don't want to make the whole school such a muffish set as the Rosebuds, do you?"]
["Immediately after came a rap at the door, and in walked Wildney, as he often did after the rest were gone to bed, merely slipping his trousers over his night-shirt, and running up to the studies.", "Well, you'll come to the Anti-muffs, won't you?"]
["Wildney looked offended.", "\"Not after we've all asked you?"]
["As he was starting, Ball caught him up and said-- \"Are you going to the Anti-muffs?\"", "\"Yes; why?"]
["Yes; do you mind our going together?"]
["Entering the back parlour, the two masters quickly took down the names of full half the boys who, in the suddenness of the surprise, had been unable to make their exit.", "And Eric?"]
["Eric just glanced round and moved slightly; he might have gone away, but that he caught a satirical look in Wildney's eye, and besides wanted to show off a little indifference to his old master, with whom he had had no intercourse since their last-mentioned conversation.", "Williams, go away instantly; what do you mean by staying after I have dismissed you?"]
["I always know what's coming when you begin to leave off calling me by my Christian name.\"", "Very well, then,\" said Duncan good-humouredly, \"what's the matter, Eric?", "Matter?", "answered Eric, pacing up and down the little room with an angry to-and-fro like a caged wild beast, and kicking everything which came in his way; \"matter?"]
["Look at me.", "What?", "won't you even look?"]
["Not Wildney, but Vernon appeared at the door.", "\"May I come in?"]
["Both seemed to remember this, and, at the same time, to remember home, and their absent parents, and their mother's prayers, and all the quiet half-forgotten vista of innocent pleasures, and sacred relationships, and holy affections.", "And why did they see each other so little at school?"]
["And remorseful Eric could not help being amazed, how, in his cruel, heartless selfishness, he had let that fair child go so far far astray; left him as a prey to such boys as were his companions in the lower-school.", "Eric, did you know I was caught to-night at the dinner?"]
["I wouldn't have minded if it had been anybody but Rose.\"", "But why?"]
["I can judge only from your outward course; but I deeply fear, Williams--I deeply fear, that in _other_ respects also you are going the down-hill road.", "And what am I to think now, when, on the _same_ morning, you and your little brother _both_ come before me for such serious and heavy faults?"]
["Eric's sprightliness, once the delight of all his friends, was now rarely exhibited, except in the company of Wildney and Graham.", "I'm so wretched, Monty,\" said Eric at last; \"do you think Rose despises me?"]
["Capital,\" said some of the worst boys present, \"we will.", "Well, who'll take part?"]
["\"What!", "are we all turning sneaks and cowards?", "Here, Wildney, won't you?"]
["\"Fiddlestick-end!", "and what if we are?"]
["A pause.", "Which of you had the audacity to throw pieces of bread at me?"]
["The boy walked in front of the desk.", "Were you one of those who threw?"]
["The boys were too much frightened to smile at the complete success of the trick.", "\"Who did this?"]
["said Owen.", "Did you observe what they were doing?", "Smoking?"]
["They were doing something which, if Eric doesn't take care, will one day be his ruin.\"", "What?"]
["Well, Wright,\" said Montagu, \"if that happens again next examination, I'd speak out about it.", "How?"]
["It's ten now.\"", "What's that to you?"]
["They hardly understood the look on Eric's countenance; he had been taking far more than was good for him; his eyes sparkled fiercely, and though as yet he said nothing, he seemed to be resenting the intrusion in furious silence.", "How much longer is this interesting lecture to last?"]
["Montagu rather looked as if he intended to give the speaker a box on the ear; but he was just deciding that he wasn't worth the trouble, when Wildney, who had been grimacing all the time, burst into a fit of satirical laughter.", "\"Here, Wildney,\" said Graham; \"just hand me _The Whole Duty of Man_, or something of that sort, from the shelf, will you?"]
["\"By Jove, I won't stand this any longer,\" shouted Eric, springing up ferociously.", "\"What on earth do you mean by daring to come in like this?"]
["I won't go for you,\" cried Wildney, clinging tight to a chair.", "Eric, why do you let him bully me?"]
["You don't know what you're about.\"", "\"Don't I?"]
["O Williams,\" said Owen, \"you are changed indeed, to treat your best friend so.", "Serve him right,\" he said; \"what business has he to interfere with what I choose to do?"]
["Little Wildney has much more.\"", "Wildney?"]
["Wildney more influence than _you_?"]
["The colour rushed into his cheeks; he went up, took Wright quietly by the hand, and said with firm determination, \"No one in the school shall touch Wright again.\"", "\"What?"]
["said several of the boys, and the cry was caught up by Ball and others.", "Shame, is it?"]
["It was too late; that moment had done the mischief, and it was now Eric's turn coldly to withdraw.", "You don't think me worthy of your friendship, and what's the good of grasping hands if we don't do it with cordial hearts?"]
["\"You didn't fight half like yourself,\" said Wildney.", "\"Can't you tell why?"]
["It was true; but Eric didn't know that half the kindness which Montagu showed to his brother was shown solely for _his_ sake.", "\"Do you know, I've thought of a plan for making you two friends again?"]
["\"Oh, have you?"]
["\"I suppose this is what they call ennui,\" said Eric again, after a pause.", "What's to be done, Sunbeam?"]
["It's Harley's night, and old Stupid will never twig.\"", "Well, whom shall we ask?"]
["We haven't seen him for an age, and he's getting too lazy even for a bit of fun.", "Good; and Graham?"]
["He and Wildney regarded their possessions so much as common property, that he hadn't the least delicacy in mentioning the boys whom he wanted to invite.", "Yes; Graham's a jolly bird; and Ball?", "I've no objection; and Pietrie?", "Well; and your brother Vernon?"]
["At any rate I won't lead _him_ into mischief any more.", "Attlay, then; and what do you say to Booking?"]
["I might as well think of doing it myself and I've never been higher than five from lag in my form yet.\"", "\"Haven't you?"]
["Eric gave a long whistle.", "But wouldn't it be stea--stea--?", "Stealing?"]
["\"Oh, I'll manage that,\" said Wildney, chuckling.", "But come again and awake me at twelve, will you?"]
["But it seemed no use knocking, and Wildney at last, in a fit of impatience, thumped a regular tattoo on the bedroom door.", "Who's there?"]
["answered Wildney, in a mild and innocent way.", "What do you want?"]
["They were themselves tired, and in the utmost trepidation; the usually courageous Wildney was trembling all over, and his fear communicated itself to Eric.", "\"What shall we do?"]
["We must make the best of our way home.\"", "Are you sure he's gone?"]
["To their great relief they heard them enter the lavatory about ten minutes after.", "Were you twigged?"]
["\"Wright,\" whispered he in a timid voice; \"just see how Eric walks.", "What can be the matter with him?"]
["Expulsion, I fear, is the only course open to us.\"", "Is not that a _very_ severe line to take?"]
["my father!\"", "sobbed Wildney at length, \"what will he say?"]
["He had often gazed before on that splendid scene, as he was now gazing on it thoughtfully with his brother by his side.", "\"What are you thinking of, Eric?"]
["WHOM THE GODS LOVE DIE YOUNG.", "Oh is it weed, or fish, or floating hair?"]
["So the Easter holidays commenced with promise, and the few first days glided away in innocent enjoyments.", "What do you say to a boat excursion to-morrow?"]
["\"Most gladly,\" said Eric, really pleased; for he saw by this that Duncan observed the improvement in his old friends, and was falling in with the endeavour to make all the boys really cordial to each other, and destroy all traces of the late factions.", "Do you mind my bringing Montagu?"]
["Directly he came in, Montagu jumped up and welcomed him cordially, and when without any allusion to the past, the two shook hands with all warmth, and looked the old proud look into each other's faces, they felt once more that their former affection was unimpaired, and that in heart they were real and loving friends.", "Couldn't you take us with you?"]
["I'm afraid not, Verny,\" said Montagu; \"the boat won't hold more than six, will it, Jim?"]
["Underneath them the water was transparent as crystal, and far below they could see the green and purple seaweeds rising like a many-coloured wood, through which occasionally they saw a fish, startled by their oars, dart like an arrow.", "Who could have been otherwise than happy in such a scene and at such a time?"]
["\"Yes,\" answered Montagu, \"_I_ always stick up for Avon Glen as the finest scene we've got about here.", "But, I say, who's that gesticulating on the rock there to the right of it?"]
["Wright had ceased to make signals, but appeared to be shouting to them, and pointing towards one corner of the glen; but though they caught the sound of his voice, they could not hear what he said.", "I wonder why Vernon isn't with him,\" said Eric anxiously; \"I hope--why, what _are_ you looking at, Charlie?", "What's that in the water there?"]
["Eric looked at him reproachfully.", "\"What's the fun of that, Monty?"]
["Oh, _don't_ let us put in there--at least not all of us.\"", "What _was_ that thing in the water?"]
["A feeling of hope and repose stole over him;--when suddenly he saw at the door, which was ajar, the leering eyes and villainously cunning countenance of Billy.", "What do you want?"]
["\"Beg pardon, sir,\" said the man, pulling his hair.", "Anything in my line, sir, to-day?"]
["answered Eric, rising up in a gust of indignation.", "\"What business have you here?"]
["\"Not had much custom from you lately, sir,\" said the man.", "\"What do you mean by having the insolence to begin talking to me?"]
["With a heart-rending sigh Eric folded and directed his letter to Mrs Trevor, and then ran out into the fresh air to relieve the qualm of sickness which had come over him.", "What was to be done?"]
["It is always so, Eric when we drink the wine it is red and sparkling, but we come afterwards to the ragged and bitter dregs.\"", "But what shall I do, sir?"]
["The man did so, but with so unmistakable an air of cunning and triumph that Eric was both astonished and dismayed.", "Could the miscreant have any further plot against him?"]
["\"Not much custom from you lately, sir,\" said Billy mockingly.", "Anything in my line to-day?", "Didn't I tell you never to come near me again, you foul villain?"]
["Soon after the seizure of the pigeons there had been a rumour that Gordon had offered a reward of this kind, but the matter had been forgotten, and the boys had long fancied their secret secure, though at first they had been terribly alarmed.", "What do you show me that for?"]
["Well?"]
["What's that to me?"]
["The idea haunted him.", "How could he ever get them?"]
["The Trevors, though liberal, were not rich, and after just sending him so large a sum, it was impossible, he thought, that they should send him five pounds more at his mere request.", "Besides, how could he be sure that Billy would not play upon his fears to extort further sums?"]
["Miserable boy!", "It was too late then?"]
["Five pounds!", "He wondered whether Montagu would lend it him, or any other boy?"]
["He stole into Montagu's study, hastily got the key, and took down the box.", "Oh, put it down, put it down, Eric,\" said Conscience; \"what business have you with it?"]
["Nobody was near therefore.", "Well, what of that?"]
["Oh, good God, yes, _even a thief_ for I _had_ actually stolen the money, until I changed my mind.", "What if they should have heard the jingle of money, or should discover the key in the box, knowing, that I was the only fellow up stairs?"]
["but Charlie ran away, saying, \"_You_, Eric!", "what?"]
["Oh, never mind,\" said Montagu; \"we can soon get another; we've got lots of money in the box.", "What had come over Eric?"]
["Wildney at once joined his friend.", "There's nothing more the matter, is there?"]
["You've been playing brilliantly, old fellow.\"", "Have I?"]
["What can have become of it?\"", "Where's the box?"]
["here's the key in the box!\"", "No, is it though?"]
["\"I'll rush straight down to tea, and ask the fellows about it.", "Would you mind requesting Rose not to come in for five minutes?"]
["For an instant the whole room was silent; Wildney and Graham interchanged anxious glances.", "Does any fellow know anything about this?", "Where is Williams?"]
["Duncan went up with Owen and Montagu to their study.", "What's to be done?"]
["\"I know what you're thinking of, Monty,\" said Duncan.", "Well, then, did you hear anything when you and I surprised Eric suddenly two days ago?"]
["I distinctly heard the jingle of money.\"", "Will he come up to the studies again to-night?"]
["During the evening he drew out a little likeness which Eric had given him, and looked at it long and earnestly.", "Is it possible?"]
["As he sat half abstracted on his bed doing nothing, Montagu and Duncan entered, and he started to see them, for they were evidently the bearers of some serious intelligence.", "Eric,\" said Duncan, \"do you know that some one has stolen all the cricket-money?", "Stolen--what--_all_?"]
["Oh, what new retribution is this?"]
["To cut matters short, Eric, do you know anything about it?"]
["Do you know anything about it?"]
["I have denied it.", "Whatever else I am, am I a liar, Monty?"]
["Yet God will forgive you if you ask Him.", "Won't you pray to Him to-night?", "I love you, Eric, still, with all my heart, and do you think God can be less kind than man?"]
["But worse than all this, he could not endure _himself_; he must fly away from the sense that _he_, Eric Williams, the brother of Vernon, the friend of Edwin Russell, was sunk in all degradation.", "Could it really, really be, that _he_, once the soul of chivalrous honour, who once would have felt a stain like a wound,--was it possible that he should have been a thief?"]
["Then his thoughts turned to the theft of the pigeons, his own drunkenness, and then his last cruel, cruel experiences, and this dreadful end of the day which, for an hour or two, had seemed so bright on that very spot where he stood.", "Could it be that this (oh, how little he had ever dreamed of it)--that this was to be the conclusion of his schooldays?"]
["There was still a light in the little sailors' tavern, and, entering, he asked the woman who kept it, \"if she knew of any ship which was going to sail next morning?\"", "Why, your'n is, bean't it, Maister Davey?"]
["\"Ees,\" grunted the man.", "Will you take me on board?"]
["You be a runaway, I'm thinking?"]
["Hardly in the cabin-boy line, I should say.", "Will you take me?"]
["Eric soon began to feel very sick, and, to make his case worse, could not endure either the taste, smell, or sight of such coarse food as was contemptuously flung to him.", "Where am I to sleep?"]
["Babby,\" said one of the sailors, \"what's your name?"]
["It lasted very long, and the sailor began to fear that his words had been prophetic.", "How is the young varmint?"]
["\"I doubt whether yon'll let you,\" answered Roberts, jerking his finger towards the skipper's cabin.", "Why?"]
["he could not meet Wildney as a sick and ragged sailor boy; perhaps even he might not be recognised if he did.", "After all, how is poor Charlie to know what has happened to me?"]
["He did not arrive there till eleven o'clock; and then he could not venture into the grounds, for he saw through the trees of the shrubbery that there was no light in any of the windows, and it was clear that they were all gone to bed.", "What was he to do?"]
["Mrs Trevor had grasped her arm.", "What is Flo doing?"]
["almost forced to believe.", "Have you ever heard--oh, how shall I put it?--have you ever heard, aunty, how things went on at Roslyn after I ran away?"]
["After they had sent home your things, I heard no more; only two most kind and excellent letters--one from Dr Rowlands, and one from your friend Mr Rose--informed me of what had happened about you.\"", "Oh, have they sent home my things?"]
["Dear little Verny, remember, is in a land where God Himself wipes away all tears from off all eyes.", "Is there anything else you would like?"]
["\"I have a plan to please you, Eric,\" said Mrs Trevor.", "\"Shall I ask Montagu and Wildney here?"]
["said Eric, leaning forward eagerly.", "Did you say that?"]
["I shall take to reading him through when I get home.", "Do you remember, Eric,\" said Montagu, \"how Rose used to chaff us in old days for our ignorance of literature, and how indignant we used to be when he asked if we'd ever heard of an obscure person called William Shakespeare?"]
["Mrs Trevor caught his look.", "\"Shall I read it aloud to you, dear?", "Do you think you can stand it?"]
["CONCLUSION.", "And hath that early hope been blessed with truth?", "Hath he fulfilled the promise of his youth?", "And borne unscathed through danger's stormy field Honour's white wreath and virtue's stainless shield?"]
["\"I have just been staying at Trinity,\" said I, \"and Owen, as I suppose you know, is doing brilliantly.", "Is he liked?"]
["You know, I suppose, that Graham is making a great start at the bar.\"", "\"Is he?"]
["\"Poor boy, he is at peace now,\" said Montagu; and he told me once more the sorrowful particulars of his death.", "Shall I read you some verses,\" he asked, \"which he must have composed, poor fellow, on board the _Stormy Petrel_ though he probably wrote them at Fairholm afterwards?"]
["So he sat down on the ground with his back to a large rock and rummaged in his pack to find a can.", "You hungry?"]
["She repeated the gesture of a while ago to brush back that same lock of almost yellow hair, but there was a change in her face which he could see even twenty feet away, and another, more subtle change about her which he had to sense.", "You're hungry, all right, aren't you?"]
["\"I stole it from a patrol warehouse a few weeks back.", "It sure does smell good, doesn't it?"]
["He knew what was going on in her mind and he believed that he was winning.", "You know we'll both be needing someone out here, don't you?"]
["Before something happened while they lay helpless in their coffins, dreaming dreams that would go on and on until reality became harsh enough to put them down.", "What if the spacefarers should return?", "What if some alien life form should grow up around some other solar type star, develop space travel, go searching for inhabitable worlds--solar type worlds--and discover Earth with it's sleeping, unaware populace?", "could dreams defend against that?"]
["They didn't know I saw them--or they would have caught me and taken me back with them.\"", "\"Where're you from?"]
["More than likely he had half wanted to give up anyway, and had not only because of the conflict of his family and saving face.", "You were the only one who got away?"]
["She examined the can again, then decided it was empty and put it down.", "Do you know what they do to people they take?"]
["Yes.", "\"Your daddy tell you?"]
["He reached back and fumbled with the side pouch on his pack.", "\"You know how to use one of these?"]
["If you fire, that'll be a signal that you've been discovered by the guards and we have to get out of there.\"", "Won't this give us away the same as shooting game?"]
["One more thing, Glynnis,\" he added.", "Are you sure you can kill a man?", "Is it hard?"]
["\"You move quiet as a cat,\" he said.", "You do this?"]
["She opened her breakfast.", "We'll be traveling most of the day?"]
["She smiled.", "You ever see an air robot?"]
["He didn't want to do that--but he couldn't help himself.", "Something wrong?"]
["There was Frank, but I was never really what you could call his wife, exactly.\"", "Many people ever stay with your folks?"]
["I wanted to go with him.\"", "Why didn't you?"]
["Nelson thought that strange.", "You ever think much about the sleepers?"]
["If they wake up, they're in a world they don't know how to live in.\"", "If you were a sleeper, what kind of world would you want to dream about?"]
["I guess they've forgotten us.\"", "You think they'll ever come back?"]
["She opened her eyes wide, and stared at him, confused and uncomprehending.", "What's wrong?", "Hear that noise?"]
["He could see the machine hanging in the center of the clearing on invisible lines of force, turning slightly to find them in the dense growth, then, with one end pointed at them, bobbing slightly with the low breeze.", "What's it doing?"]
["We don't have much time before they get here.\"", "But if the machine can't be shot down what can we do?"]
["Now it's on full.", "Will that stop the machine?"]
["Nelson felt the dryness of his throat as he raised his gun to aim at the incurious machine.", "All set?"]
["It took a tremendous exertion of will to make his arm return the gun to its holster.", "What can we do?"]
["\"Glynnis\"--the man on the table was saying.", "Is he waking up?"]
["This is the solution.\"", "\"A drug-induced dream state?"]
["\"It's a pretty good one.", "\"How can anyone be happy like that?"]
["* * * * * From far off, Nelson heard Glynnis calling to him.", "Are you all right, Hal?"]
["Can you hear me, Hal?"]
["\"You did a fine job,\" he told Glynnis, meaning it.", "Can you fly a patrol ship?", "Huh?"]
["\"It doesn't need fuel; it can fly forever.", "You know what that means Glynnis?"]
["And we can get into the mausoleums and wake everybody up?"]
["But Glynnis grabbed his arm and stopped him.", "What is it?"]
["What's it like to live in a world where everyone's awake?"]
["I don't know, I've never lived in one.\"", "Then why do you want to wake everyone up?"]
["He felt sympathy for her, knowing how she felt.", "\"What I mean,\" she asked finally, \"is why is it wrong?"]
["The difficulties they put forward are mainly of a moral order.", "Should not the child now begin to respect the will of others rather than his own?", "Should he not some day brace himself to a real effort, compelling him to carry out a necessary, rather than a chosen, task?", "Finally, should he not learn self-sacrifice, since man's life is not a life of ease and enjoyment?"]
["What do you propose?", "Would you abolish all this, or do you admit that the child must inevitably bow to these necessities?"]
["Indirectly, these questions have been answered already by the progress made in the treatment of infants under the guidance of hygiene.", "How were they treated formerly?"]
["Who does not remember the various devices for helping a baby to walk?"]
["The child, suddenly left to himself after being accustomed hitherto to supports comparable to the crutches of the cripple, fell perpetually, and the crown was a protection to the head, which would otherwise have been injured.", "What were the revelations of Science, when it entered upon the scene for the salvation of the child?"]
["But when all these things are lacking, we are vanquished.", "What are we to do then?"]
["It is Nature, \"creation,\" which regulates all these things.", "If we are convinced of this, we must admit as a principle the necessity of \"not introducing obstacles to natural development\"; and instead of having to deal with many separate problems--such as, what are the best aids to the development of character, intelligence and feeling?--one single problem will present itself as the basis of all education: How are we to give the child freedom?"]
["Woe to us, when we believe ourselves responsible for matters that do not concern us, and delude ourselves with the idea that we are perfecting things that will perfect themselves quite independently of us!", "For then we are like lunatics; and the profound question arises: What, then, is our true mission, our true responsibility?", "If we are deceiving ourselves, what is indeed the truth?", "And what sins of omission and of commission must be laid to our charge?"]
["There must be many persons who, like myself, have heard such dialogues as this: \"I have had great experience in the care of children; I have had nine.\"", "And how many of them are living?"]
["Suckling of infants was carried out quite irregularly; the cries of the child were the sole guide whereby its feeding times, whether by night or day, were determined; and the more it suffered from indigestion and the resulting pains, the more frequently was it fed, to the constant aggravation of its sufferings.", "Who in those days might not have seen mothers carrying in their arms babies flushed with fever, perpetually thrusting the nipple into the little howling mouth in the hope of quieting it?"]
["No infant should ever be given crusts of bread to suck, as is often done by mothers, especially among the lower orders, to still its crying, because particles of bread might be swallowed, which the child is yet incapable of digesting.", "The mothers' anxiety then was: what are we to do when the baby cries?"]
["Why indeed should they cry continually?"]
["Not only did infants survive in very much greater numbers as soon as the obstacles of certain fundamental errors were swept away, but it was at once apparent that there was an improvement in their development.", "Was it really hygiene which helped them to increase in weight, stature, and beauty, and improved their material development?"]
["Who, as the Gospel says, can by taking thought add one cubit to his stature?"]
["We must behold him amidst our tumultuous human society and see how with heroic vigor he aspires to life.", "What are the rights of children?"]
["When they are born they possess nothing but potentialities; they have to do everything in a world which, as even adults admit, is full of difficulties.", "What is done to help these frail pilgrims in an unknown world?"]
["At a period in which civilization, that is, the possibility of right living, is based upon rights energetically acquired and consecrated by laws, what rights has he who comes among us without strength and without thought?", "Let us see how social justice receives the infant when he enters the world.", "What is an orphan asylum?"]
["The greatest criminal may retain memories of his mother, knows that he has had a name, and may derive some consolation from his recollections, comparable to the soothing reflections of one who having become blind recalls the beauty of colors and the splendor of the sun; but the foundling is as one born blind.", "Every malefactor has more rights than he; and yet who could be more innocent?"]
["The persons imprisoned by tyrants because they had happened to be witnesses of their crimes, and who were cast into dungeons where darkness and inaudible suffering were henceforth their unhappy portion, at least roused the people to proclaim the principle of equal justice for all.", "But who will lift up his voice for our foundlings?"]
["And to save honor and good name, what society would not with one accord sacrifice more \"flowers\"?"]
["Yet what distress is felt whenever the young of some animal is parted from its mother!", "Is it not so in the case of puppies and kittens?"]
["An administrator of landed estate who should sell the property belonging to his master, make money out of it for his own enjoyment, and leave the rightful owner in the direst poverty, is a criminal difficult to imagine.", "For who would buy a property without the signature of the owner?"]
["What can be a more sacred right than that of the baby to his mother's milk?"]
["All his wealth is there: strength to live, to grow, to acquire vigor are contained in that nourishment.", "If the defrauded infant should become weak and rickety, what would become of him, condemned by poverty to a hard calling?"]
["In civilized countries rich mothers have been induced to suckle their children because hygienists have proved that this is beneficial to the baby's health, but not because it has been recognized that the \"civil right\" of the adult extends to the infant.", "It may be asked: what if the mother is ill and _unable_ to suckle her child?"]
["Why should another have to suffer for his misfortune?"]
["When we begin seriously to examine the problem of the moral education of the child, we ought to look around us a little, and survey the world we have prepared for him.", "Are we willing that he should become like us, unscrupulous in our dealings with the weak?", "that like us, his consciousness should harbor ideas of a justice which stops short at those who make no protests?", "Are we willing to make him like ourselves half a civilized man in our dealings with our equals, and half a wild beast when we encounter the innocent and oppressed?"]
["The social question of the child is obviously the more complete and profound; it is the question of our present and of our future.", "If we can reconcile to our conscience deeds of such grave injustice, not to say crimes, without recognizing them as such, what minor forms of oppression shall we not readily condone in our dealings with the child?"]
["To impede their activity would be to do violence to their lives.", "But what is the usual method with young children?"]
["And yet we ourselves are very sensitive as to our rights in our own work; it offends us if any one attempts to supplant us; in the Bible the sentence, \"And his place shall another take\" is among the threats to the lost.", "What should we do if we were to become the slaves of a people incapable of understanding our feelings, a gigantic people, very much stronger than ourselves?"]
["How often one of those marvelous moments when their attention is fixed, and that process of organization which is to develop them begins in their souls, is roughly interrupted; moments when the spontaneous efforts of the young child are groping blindly in its surroundings after sustenance for its intelligence.", "Do we not all retain an impression of something having been forever stifled in our lives?"]
["Imagine these men at such psychological moments, broken in upon by some brutal person shouting to them to follow him at once, taking them by the hand, or pushing them out by the shoulders.", "And for what?"]
["It consists of a cell with perfectly bare gray walls, opening only into a narrow strip of ground enclosed by high walls, where the criminal may walk in the fresh air, because the open country is all around him, though it is hidden from his sight.", "What is lacking here for the body?"]
["Not only their minds but their bodies perish after a few years.", "What causes death?"]
["To die of hunger in nine days like Count Ugolino is a more cruel fate than to be burnt to death in half an hour like Giordano Bruno; but to die of starvation of the spirit in a term of years is the most cruel of all the punishments hitherto devised for the castigation of man.", "If a robust and brutal criminal can perish from starvation of the soul, what will be the fate of the infant if we take no account of his spiritual needs?"]
["The problems that present themselves to him are innumerable and acute; they form as it were a hedge of thorns separating him from his pupils.", "What must first of all be devised, to win the attention of his pupils, so that he may be able to introduce into their minds all that seems to him necessary?", "How is he to offer them an idea in such a manner that they will retain it in their memories?"]
["Another difficulty is that of economizing the powers of the pupils, that is to say, utilizing them to the utmost without wasting them.", "How much rest is necessary?", "How long should any particular work be carried on?"]
["But what instruction is best adapted to the powers of a child during the various hours of the day?", "Is it best to begin with mathematics or with dictation?", "At what hours will the child be most inclined to exercise his powers of imagination, at 9 in the morning or at 11?", "How should he write on the blackboard so that the children seated at a distance may see?"]
["And how much light shall fall upon the blackboard, in order that all may see clearly the white characters on the black surface?", "Of what size should be the script specially chosen by the master to suit distant vision?"]
["A serious matter indeed!", "* * * * * What consideration has ever been given to the state of anxiety of such a teacher?", "To get some idea of his anxiety we may think of a young wife about to become a mother, who should set herself such problems as the following: how can I create an infant, if I know nothing of anatomy; how can I form its skeleton?"]
["I must then learn how the muscles are attached; but how will it be possible to put the brain into a closed box?", "And must the little heart go on beating continually until death?", "Is it possible that it will not weary?"]
["There are also tallow candles; these are very greasy and have a disgreeable smell when burning.", "_Memory_.--Have you ever seen a candle-factory?", "Have you ever seen a bee-hive?", "Of what are the cells of the honeycomb made?", "When do you light a candle?", "Have you ever carried a lighted candle carelessly?", "Did not this cause a disaster?"]

["You should be pleasant when you are conferring some favor, otherwise the favor will seem irksome.", "When you want something, do you ask for it arrogantly?"]
["On the other hand, if you ask politely for something, will it not be difficult to refuse you?"]
["Everything is clean; everything is in order; I am so fond of you; you are so fond of me.", "Isn't this true, children?"]
["Me too (correct).", "Tell me, Gino, are you cold?"]
["But perhaps this is not allowed.", "To whom does the snow belong?"]
["Who bought it?", "Who made it?", "You?"]
["I?"]
["Your mother?"]
["Then did your father buy it?"]
["I will take mine too, the one I made with you.", "It is larger than yours; so which will hold more snow, mine or yours?"]
["How cold the snow is!", "Did you notice how cold it made your hands, which were quite warm?"]
["Say that, Guido.", "What is the word?"]
["And the snow which is so cold is ... what?", "Who can guess?"]
["_Children_.--Snow.", "What is it the stove gives us?"]
["_Children_.--Flour.", "And what else?"]

["\"No,\" says the professor.", "Now what is it you do see?"]
["It must not be forgotten that they are obliged to remain seated and quiet, each one in his place, and that they are not to move.", "Well, what do you see?"]

["First over the flower-garden, and round by the aviary, where Mamma's gold and silver pheasants were kept; and then into the green-house, where Poll, the parrot, hung in her great gilt cage, swinging about amongst the flowers, dancing up and down, and shrieking out whenever anybody came by; then swaying backwards and forwards in the ring in the cage, and climbing up and down all over the bars, this way and that way, head up and head down, and all the time looking as wicked and cunning as a hook-beaked old grey parrot can look.", "Sam, Sam, where's the master?"]
["said Fred, angrily, and binding his handkerchief round the place; \"I'd kill it if I had my way.\"", "But it was your fault,\" said Harry, quietly, \"for trying to touch it; wasn't it?"]
["What do you keep it for?\"", "\"Keep it for?"]
["Oh!", "what would Papa say if he came?"]
["\"No, I shan't tell,\" said Fred, stoutly, with his face half in the pail, and the words all the time half choked by that sob which would keep rising from his overburdened heart.", "\"But I'm not a coward, though, am I?"]
["Just then Harry came sneaking into the stable, looking dreadfully ashamed of himself, with his face smeared all over with blood from his bleeding nose, and carrying in his hand the body of the poor ferret: for it would frighten no more poor rats or rabbits to death, having met with its own by being trampled upon during the fray.", "Will you shake hands?"]
["But then I was wrong first I say, though, don't be hard on a fellow, for I do want to be jolly with you, and make you comfortable; but I'm such a vicious beast, and always getting into a row, ain't I, Phil?\"", "\"But I say, though,\" said Harry, wiping his face with his pocket handkerchief, \"it's all right again, ain't it?"]
["\"Yes, to be sure,\" said Fred, smiling.", "But who killed the poor ferret?"]
["\"I want some hot water,\" said Fred, grumpily.", "What for?"]
["said Fred, in a burst of admiration as he went to the window, half dressed; \"oh!", "isn't it beautiful?"]
["I wish I had got up sooner.\"", "Do you?"]
["\"Now then, Master Harry, you're at it again!", "What's the use of my trying to keep the garden nice if you will keep racing about over it like that?"]
["We ain't going to, though, are we, Phil?"]
["Old Sam would be sure to fetch us out again if we did; wouldn't you, Sam?"]
["The pretty breakfast-room looked so bright and cheerful; there was such an odorous bunch of dew-wet roses in a vase; such sweet scents, too, came through the open window, and such country farm-house bounty spread upon the breakfast-table, that Fred told his cousins after the meal that he had never enjoyed anything before half so well in his life.", "Now, boys, what are you going to do to-day?"]
["Why didn't you pull it out when I told you?\"", "How could I,\" said Harry, \"when it was dragging so?"]
["\"I'm all right,\" said Harry, creeping slowly out upon the branch; and then, seating himself astride, he began to work himself out over the water, while the bough quivered and bent at every movement.", "Can you see it, Phil?"]
["said Harry.", "\"Come in, Mary,\" said Mrs Inglis; \"what's the matter?"]
["come along,\" said Harry at last; \"I know what we'll do.\"", "What?"]
["come along, you'll see,\" said the other.", "Whatever is the matter?"]
["he continued, as they heard another scream similar to one that had caused the first start.", "What's the matter?"]
["Then there was the syphon to draw all the water off into the pails, which Sam had to come and empty; and this syphon puzzled Fred a great deal, for he could not understand how the water could run up, and then down the other side.", "\"Well, but,\" said Mr Inglis, \"have you not learnt that at school in your lessons on physics?"]
["said Bob, gruffly, jumping up.", "\"Oh, it's you, young masters, is it?"]
["\"None of your gammon, Bob.", "Think I don't know better than that?"]
["\"'Cos I ain't in such a hurry as you are,\" replied Bob.", "You'd like me to run, wouldn't you, eh?"]
["that's a pretty go,\" said Bob; \"shan't catch many fish that a way, anyhow.\"", "Why, what's the matter?"]
["\"I know who it was,\" said Harry, again.", "Who?"]
["\"Who?"]
["chorused the boys, \"what a pity!\"", "Why didn't you be quicker, Bob?"]
["Do be careful next time.\"", "Why, wasn't I careful?"]
["There ain't no holding of them at all when there are no holes in the bottom of the traps; and of course I couldn't stop that un without any salt to put on his tail.\"", "Don't talk such stuff,\" said Philip; \"we are not children, and you don't think we believe all that rubbish about salt on tails, do you?"]
["Two or three sacks were laid upon the mill floor, and then Bob emptied the pail, and there they were, flapping, leaping, and writhing about; such a collection of fish as would have made any angler glow and feel proud to carry home.", "Now, what's to be done with them all?"]
["I'm coming across now,\" and in spite of the protestations of Philip and Fred, he got sloth fashion-- hanging hands and legs--upon the pole that had served as a hand rail to the broken plank, and which maintained its own bearings, and in spite of its bending beneath his weight, he shuffled across, and stood wet and dripping beside his companions.", "Come on,\" said Harry, shaking himself again, and addressing the others, who were still standing with long faces by the broken bridge: \"let's run; we shall soon be home, and nobody will meet us in Park Lane.", "But where's the basket?"]
["Never mind, boys,\" said Mr Inglis; \"I dare say we can make it all right with Bob, the miller; and no doubt there are as fine eels in the river as ever came out of it.", "As for Mrs Inglis, she seemed to take a more loving fancy to Fred than she had before accorded to her sister's child; for had he not saved her boy's life?"]
["So they did, Master Harry; you're right.", "And you found them up against the grating?"]
["And then you brought them here?"]
["Besides which, there were rats there, and stray sticklebacks: and the nicest, smoothest, and roundest pebbles for throwing to be got anywhere; besides, boots and feet soon get dry again in the summer-time; and, after all, a good bit of fun is worth all the wet boots in the world--at least, boys of twelve and thirteen think so.", "Is it all wet, like this?"]
["\"Let's get some water-cresses and take home,\" said Phil.", "Where are there any?"]
["On every shallow, shoals of roach and dace appeared, and rushed out in silvery squadrons over the pebbly bottom; while the minnows and gudgeon seemed as though they had been drilled, so regularly and closely they kept together as they darted out into the middle of the river.", "Plenty to be seen?"]
["Now and then red and orange billed moor-hens would lead their dusky little broods from amongst the reeds, and after a short swim, lead them in again when they saw that they were watched.", "Plenty to see?"]
["let's turn back.\"", "I wonder what time it is?"]
["This was soon done, and, the cart coming round, it was packed with the different odds and ends that naturalists take with them when going to the sea-side; and also with those agreeable refreshments taken by all people, whether naturalists or not, when they anticipate being by the rocks and shingle for a few hours in the fresh sea-breeze.", "Now, boys, which way shall we go; down by the marsh, or along the upland at once to the rocks?"]
["It is so nice and quiet riding along the sands.\"", "\"Yes,\" said his father; \"but how about old Tom, here?"]
["Now, Fred,\" said Mr Inglis, \"fill your jar with water, and pick that fine fellow off the rock.", "It won't bite, will it?"]
["\"Bite?"]
["what an old stupid!\"", "I don't care,\" said Philip; \"I know it would be nice; wouldn't it, Fred?"]
["\"But what makes all that thick bunch of hay and rags up there?"]
["said Harry, \"I can do it;\" and running along under the great branches that stretched away, drooping towards the ground, he gave a spring, and caught a bough, turned up his heels, and so made his way, hanging head downwards, to the trunk after the same fashion as he did on the day of the fishing excursion.", "Well, why don't you throw the nest down?"]
["\"'Cos I can't,\" said Harry.", "\"Why don't you come and sit up here, and look at the blue sky, and then perhaps you could?"]
["\"Yes,\" said Harry; \"and snakes and adders, and the dark tarn where the great eels are.", "But never mind, you can stop; can't he, Phil?"]
["said Philip.", "Why don't you go round the other side, Harry, and swim?"]
["Saying which he took his seat upon the mossy trunk of an old fallen tree, an example which Fred was not long in following; and there they waited, enjoying the delicious sensation of rest felt in a shady spot after a long, toilsome walk, and thinking very little about poor Harry.", "What a while Harry is,\" said Fred at last; \"isn't he coming?"]
["Is it poisonous?\"", "Come on,\" said Philip, \"let's go.", "But how about Harry?"]
["\"Oh, I say,\" said Philip, who was nearly as bad, \"don't look like that, or we shall never get out of the wood.", "Don't you know what a many times Robert Bruce tried before he got his kingdom?"]
["Do you think we ever shall get out again?"]
["No, come on,\" said the other, \"for poor Mamma will be so frightened.", "Oh, and won't Uncle be cross?"]
["This seemed to act as a kind of comfort to Philip, who resumed his meal, but only to find out a new trouble directly after.", "Where's my snake?"]
["\"Sarvant, sir,\" said Bob, as he saw who it was, and then burst out into a grin; for behind Squire Inglis stood his visitors of a few days before, and Bob was luxuriating in the recollection of how he had restored the lost basket of fish.", "Well, Bob,\" said Mr Inglis, entering the mill, followed by the three boys, each armed with a fishing-rod and basket, big enough apparently to hold a great many more fish than they would catch that afternoon; \"Well, Bob,\" said Mr Inglis, \"how are you off for fish?"]
["Well, this was the case here: Bob had seen a pike so big that no mortal rod and line could ever bear it; he could tell of somewhere about ten or a dozen fishermen who had once had hold of him, so that Mr Jack must have thought no more of the sharpest barbed hooks than he would of so many quill toothpicks.", "\"Lord, sir,\" said Bob, \"whoy doan't thee trowl for the big jack?"]
["This brought the fishing to a conclusion for that afternoon; and so the lines were wound up, rods disjointed and placed in their bags, and all the rest of the angling paraphernalia collected into the baskets, while one was expressly devoted to the fish.", "But now a new difficulty arose-- the chub could be got into the basket, but how about a pike two feet six inches long?"]
["\"We will be so careful for the future.", "And--and,\" said Harry, breaking down as he spoke; \"and--and--indeed, Papa, I wish it had been me to-day sooner than poor Fred, for we do feel that we ought to take care of him when he's a visitor; don't we, Philip?"]
["What's that?", "said Mr Inglis; \"pitched into Fred?"]
["said Philip, now coming up quite out of breath.", "Why, you ride better than we do; don't he, Hal?"]
["But when the boys had made themselves respectable, and descended again to breakfast, all this involved some rather serious talk upon the part of Mr and Mrs Inglis, but did not seem to spoil the boys' breakfast the least bit in the world; while as to the cake, they said it wasn't a bit the worse, only rather gritty with a few little bits of china that had been left in from the broken plate.", "Well, boys,\" said Mr Inglis at last, \"what have you been doing this morning?"]
["Now, Master Phil, if you'll promise not to bother me any more, I'll put you all up to something.", "What is it?"]
["Old Sam made sure of the barrow by sitting down upon the edge, and would have been canted over by Harry, only he expected, and very naturally, that it would make the poor old man cross.", "Now, Sam, what is it?"]
["Do come, please,\" he continued aloud.", "Well, what is it?"]
["Well, you know, you promised to be quiet, you know, didn't you?"]
["Here, Fred,\" he said, holding out the bellows, \"you do it.\"", "Do what?"]
["said Philip, when there was no more danger: and when he had got his breath again, \"What a game!\"", "\"Booh,\" said Harry; \"was it?"]
["But one thing was very certain, and that was, that he would have backed out of the task even if Harry had given it up to him.", "Can't we fetch the bellows?"]
["\"Ain't got it,\" said Harry, shortly.", "How's that?"]
["Sam was done for a moment; but a bright thought flashed across his brain.", "Who's afraid?"]
["I don't suppose Harry could smell the roast beef when he was a mile from home, but sure enough it was done when the boys got there, and they had only just time to get themselves ready before the dinner-bell rang.", "Well, boys, I suppose you have been very quiet,\" said Mr Inglis, \"and are ready for a good long walk this afternoon?"]
["The other boys ran breathlessly up, while Mr Inglis drew from his pocket a large-sized pill-box and a pair of forceps, and on coming up to the spot where Philip and the other boys were, he stooped down to secure the prize.", "Well, where is it?"]
["As they came up to the wood Fred stopped short, for from out of its dark recesses came a peculiar whirring sound, as if somebody was busy with a spinning-wheel.", "Whatever is that?"]
["said Harry, laughing, \"that's old Dame Durden spinning her yarn.\"", "What?"]
["If we could only secure specimens like that, what rare ones we should get sometimes of those that always fly high out of our reach!", "There, did you see him catch that moth, high up above the big bough?"]
["The roses were getting washed clear of the blight that had begun to cover them; and everything seemed to be drinking in the soft cooling drops that fell so gently and bathed the face of nature, for during Fred's visit the only rain that had fallen was that which accompanied the thunderstorm, and since then the hot sun had drawn all the moisture from the surface, so that many things began to appear parched, and to flag in the noontide heat.", "\"Now ain't that sneaky, Phil, to call two fellows up and then go and crawl into bed again?"]
["\"I know you weren't,\" said Philip.", "How do you know that?"]
["How do you know that you were?"]
["\"I didn't,\" said Fred, indignantly.", "\"That you did; didn't he, Philip?"]
["At last they burst, pell-mell, into the study, as if they were soldiers about to sack a town, and perhaps, too, a little more impetuously.", "Gently, gently,\" said Mr Inglis, who was sitting there reading; \"what's the matter?"]
["\"Well, you see if I don't tell,\" said Philip.", "I know old Sam has hidden them because we walked all down the gravel-walk last month, before Fred came; and don't you remember it was wet, and we pretended that it was a flood, and that we were obliged to use the stilts to keep out of the water; and then Sam went and told Papa that we had made the path all full of holes with the stilts?"]
["We want our stilts, that you've got somewhere.\"", "Laws, Master Henry,\" said the old man, pretending to be innocent, \"whatever made you think of that?"]
["No, but you've hid them away somewhere; so tell us directly.", "Stilts--stilts,\" said Sam, wonderingly; \"what's stilts?"]
["There,\" he said, \"I'm bet out with you; come out, and I'll tell ee wheer the stilts are.", "Honour bright, Sam?"]
["\"I knew he'd hid them,\" said Philip.", "Now, then,\" said Harry, \"where are they?"]
["\"Stump--stump; stump--stump; stump--stump,\" went Harry again, but keeping well clear of obstructions this time.", "Whatever is that noise?"]
["\"Stump--stump; stump--stump; crish--crash--dangle,\" said the stilts, the lamp, and Harry's head.", "Whatever are those boys doing?"]
["Some of the beeches were almost covered with grey or creamy patches, of the most beautiful patterns and tints; while wherever a rotten bough, or fallen tree, lay upon the ground, the moss seemed to have taken full possession, and completely covered it with a velvety pile.", "I'm so thirsty, Phil,\" said Harry, all at once; \"where's the old spring?"]
["Meanwhile Fred was looking at the place where the earth had crumbled down, for his curiosity had been excited by what at first sight appeared to be a bit of old iron, of a very peculiar shape, and then, just beyond it, what bore the appearance of a bone, but so earthy that it crumbled under his foot.", "I say; look here,\" said he, pointing to something half enclosed in earth; \"what's that?"]
["We must have spades and pickaxes up here to-morrow, if we can get permission: but let's turn over the gravel with our sticks; we may, perhaps, find something more to-day.\"", "But won't the skulls and bones be nasty, and poisonous, uncle?"]
["I do not mean what we commonly call salt, which is chloride of sodium, but of earthy salts.\"", "Well, but how can that be, Papa?"]
["Has it ever been proved?"]
["What did they often do with their dead, Harry?\"", "Why, buried them, didn't they?"]
["Oh, ah; so it was,\" said Harry; \"I forgot.", "Why, they used to burn them; didn't they, Papa?"]
["\"To be sure they did,\" said his father.", "And what were their urns for?"]
["\"For shame, Hal,\" said Mr Inglis, good-humouredly.", "\"Why, the ashes of the dead were collected and preserved in these cinereal urns; and what are ashes but earthy salts?"]
["\"Ha-a-a-a,\" said Sam at last, with a comical look at Harry.", "Shall I fetch you the wedges, Sam?"]
["Eh?"]
["Shall I fetch the wedges?"]
["By listening to such a glowing account of the place, Fred's mind grew so excited that he would have liked to have started at once for the lake, and feasted his eyes upon the wonders; but the butcher's was now reached, and the fat dame in the shop having been told of the cause of their visit, \"Willum,\" the boy, was called, who armed himself with a skewer, and then took the lads to a vile-smelling shed, where lay a heap of sheepskins and a bullock's hide, and from the insides of these, and, by poking out from amongst tendons of an old shin bone, the little tin box was soon filled with the great, fat, white maggots, the end of whose life, the beginning, and the middle, and all the rest of it, seemed to be to keep continually in motion with one incessant wriggle.", "And where indeed were there such others?"]
["That won't be half a kite.\"", "Won't it?"]
["Why, I can climb up and get that,\" said Harry, \"I know.", "Well, why don't you try?"]
["It was a most fortunate thing that he was not injured seriously; but a few bruises and scratches were the full extent of the damages done to his skin, though his trousers and shirt told a very different tale.", "There,\" said Harry again, rubbing the green off his trousers, \"I told you I could get the tail, didn't I?"]
["There's an old meadow-crake,\" said Harry, who was holding the kite: \"let's go and hunt him up; perhaps we could catch it.", "But who's to hold the kite?"]
["\"Creek--creek,\" said the landrail, far enough down, away from where it had been heard at first.", "There's an old stupid,\" said Philip; \"why, where are you?"]
["\"Creek--creek; creek--creek; creek--creek,\" cried the bird, apparently here, there, and everywhere, but always invisible; and up and down, and round and round, ran the boys, until they all stood together at last, wiping the perspiration from their faces, and fanning themselves with their caps; while the provoking \"Creek-creek\" kept on as bad as ever for a while, and then all at once stopped; and, though they waited and listened attentively for a long while, not another sound could they hear.", "Ain't it funny,\" said Philip, \"that you never can tell where those things are?"]
["perhaps there may be; but I think there's only one.", "Did you ever read the `Boys' Country Book,' Fred?"]
["\"It's blown away,\" said Fred; \"let's go and find it;\" and off he started in the teeth of the wind.", "What's the good of that?"]
["All at once Fred called out that he had caught a big one, and, from the way his rod bent, this was evidently the case--the fish seeming to be making determined efforts to perform the feat described by Harry and Philip--namely, that of sticking his tail into the mud and there anchoring himself.", "Isn't it a big one, Papa?"]
["Harry did not mind it much; but Philip was obliged to go behind the large clump of laurustinus and pull out his handkerchief and blow his nose a great deal, and wipe the eyes that would brim over.", "What's the matter, Philip?"]
["\"Come in,\" said Mr Inglis, and in came Mary, trying to look very serious, but evidently struggling with a laugh which would keep crinkling up the corners of her mouth, although she kept smoothing them out with her apron.", "Well, Mary?"]
["But he did not look in bowing trim, his face, buff waistcoat, and shirt, presenting a currant-dumpling appearance rather ludicrous to gaze upon, for they were specked and spotted all over; while his white duck trousers, far above his knees, were dyed of a pitchy black hue, and covered with abominably smelling black mud.", "Now, sir,\" said Mr Jones; \"pray, sir, what have you to say to this, sir?"]
["But may I inquire why I am favoured with this visit?", "\"Favoured, sir?", "Visit, sir?", "What the ten thousand furies do you mean, sir?"]
["Do you see them, sir?\"", "Of course I see them,\" said Mr Inglis, \"and I am sorry to see that you have met with so unfortunate an accident; but pray what has it to do with me?", "To do with you, sir?"]
["\"But you did not tell me where the pitfall was made,\" said Mr De Vellum, the solicitor.", "Made, sir?"]
["What, where the finger-post stands at the corner?"]
["\"It was a stone, I think,\" said Philip.", "But who was to have thrown it?"]
["He did not say, \"Yah-ah-ah-ha,\" now, but \"boo-hoo-hoo-hooed\" dreadfully; and at last came out-- \"We shouldn't ha' touched you if that genelman hadn't given us a shilling each to pay you at out.\"", "What gentleman?"]
["To begin with, his cap would not go on so as to cover his bruised forehead; his eyes were reduced to narrow slits, so that he could scarcely see; while his mouth was drawn down all on one side.", "Only look what an old gutta-percha head,\" said Philip; \"don't he seem as if some one had been squeezing him out of shape?"]
["Oh, don't, Phil; it does hurt so.", "I say,\" said Fred, \"however are we to go in to tea?"]
["But not a bit of it, for the horse took the hedge in a flying leap, and then went galloping on through the corn-field on the other side, and then he came to a stand-still right in the middle of the waving grain, and began to nibble off the green sweet ears.", "But where was Harry?"]
["\"Here he bes,\" said a voice, and the great brown face of one of the carters peered over the hedge.", "Art t'e hurt, Maester Harry?"]
["said Fred.", "There, again, did you see that?"]
["However, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we did our best to save them.\"", "But what is insurance?"]
["\"Well, I know that,\" said Harry; \"but it's always best to be in good time about everything, and then you don't get all behind.", "I say, what shall we do this morning?"]
["\"Why, what's the use,\" said Philip, \"when you know how busy he is about the fire?"]
["Fred began looking up in the tree and amidst the laurel bushes--parting the boughs, and peering amidst the great green leaves.", "What are you looking for?"]
["I shan't hurt anything,\" said Harry brusquely.", "\"Do you think I don't know what I'm about?"]
["\"Why, it's a snake,\" said Philip.", "How could a snake get there?"]
["\"There must have been an egg laid in the hole,\" said Fred; offering, as he thought, a very clever solution of the difficulty.", "Well, but how did the egg get there?"]
["No, it wouldn't,\" said Harry; \"it's only adders that bite and poison; snakes are quite harmless; Papa says so, and he knows everything.", "Does he?"]
["\"And so, Master Hal, you consider that Papa knows everything, do you?"]
["Philip placed a piece of wood in the hole again, and in a moment there came forth the same sharp hiss, and directly Philip darted back in the same way as his brother had a short time before.", "There, did you hear that?"]
["I'll give it him.\"", "Well, what shall we do?"]
["Can't you drive them out with a long whip?"]
["I say, Phil, old chap, I'm so tired; do go and fetch the whip.", "What's the good?"]
["\"What!", "the bobs?"]
["\"Oh, but we have been so busy since the fire, Bob,\" said Harry, and he spoke as though he really believed that they had been busy; but, if asked what they had been busy about, I think it very doubtful whether Master Harry could have given a satisfactory answer.", "Never mind about that though, now,\" said Harry; \"where are the bobs?"]
["I've got 'em all right,\" said Bob; \"but I don't see why I couldn't have a drop o' beer up at t' fire, as well as other folks.\"", "Well, why didn't you?"]
["I dunno,\" said Bob; \"I knows I never got none, and other folks got lots; and I says to my mate as it warn't fair.\"", "Well, but why didn't you have some, Bob?"]
["There was no stopping to bait the hook, and no disengaging the fish from the bait, for they let go of the worstedy worm as soon as they were lifted out of the water, or as soon as they could drag their teeth out of the woolly delicacy; and as to biting, they seized the bob with the greatest eagerness, for it was evident that the mill-dam swarmed with the eel tribe, now seeking their prey upon the warm summer evening--evidently a time when they loved to leave their muddy abodes.", "How many have you caught, Fred?"]
["\"Six,\" said Fred, in a half whisper; for he had one just then at his bob.", "Why, where are they then?"]
["Here's another, such a big one,\" he continued, as he landed one nearly as thick as his wrist.", "How many have you got, Phil?"]
["But Fred had not, for, in spite of the many bites he obtained, not a fish could he draw out of the water; for without exception they all fell in again, he not having yet hit upon the knack of landing them, which should be done with a quick but gentle motion; for the slightest jerk makes the eel loose its hold.", "I say, how do you do it?"]
["Do what?"]
["said Harry, all at once, just as they were going up to bed.", "What is a pity?"]
["What would you have said if I had gone without you?\"", "\"We weren't afraid of that,\" said Harry; \"were we, boys?"]
["A moment's glance served to show Mr Inglis that the cry proceeded from one of the bathers, and, in company with many more people, he ran down to the water's edge, when he could see that a boy was battling with the waves, his head just above water, and crying for help in the most heartrending tones.", "Is there no one here that can swim?"]
["Don't I wish that they were all to come over again; there's lots of things we have not done yet, and lots of places where we ought to have gone.\"", "When are you coming down again, Fred?"]
["I am sorry that your cousin must leave you; but I feel glad to see that he leaves us with regret, for that seems to say that he has enjoyed his trip.", "Is it not so, Fred?"]
["\"Oh!", "may I?"]
["Do, Papa, write and ask for another week's holiday for him!", "\"But you go back to school yourselves the day after to-morrow,\" said Mr Inglis; \"and what would you do then?"]
["In response to Hull's urgent appeal, Dearborn, who was puttering about between Boston and Albany, confessed that he knew nothing about what was going on at Niagara.", "He ranked as the commander-in-chief of the American forces and he awoke from his habitual stupor to ask himself this amazing question: \"Who is to have the command of the operations in Upper Canada?"]

["Shame, where is thy blush?"]
["that a few short months should have so altered the tone of British sentiments!", "Is it true, or is it not, that our navy was accustomed to hold the Americans in utter contempt?", "Is it true, or is it not, that the _Guerri\u00e8re_ sailed up and down the American coast with her name painted in large characters on her sails in boyish defiance of Commodore Rodgers?"]
["Five hundred merchantmen and three frigates!", "Can these statements be true; and can the English people hear them unmoved?"]
["If it was the destiny of the War of 1812 to weld the nation as a union, the spirit of the consummation was expressed for all time in the lines which a hundred million of free people sing today: O!", "say can you see by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?"]

["I had a hand sprayer, but when I mixed the lime-sulphur and the arsenate of lead it almost stopped up.", "What was the matter, was it the mixture or the sprayer?"]
["Mr. Sauter: How long must they stand dissolved?"]
["It would not go through the strainer.", "Mr. Sauter: How does the powdered arsenate compare with the paste?"]
["While the hydrated is very nice to use it did not possess the adhesive quality that the regular slaked lime did, and it would wash off the trees and take the vitriol solution with it, and we discontinued its use.", "Mr. Sauter: You think it best for anybody with a small orchard to make his own lime-sulphur solution?"]
["My grandfather on my mother's side has told me that some of his relatives in Scotland were once accused of doing considerable injury to plantations of firs and pines by gnawing off the top shoots, which you know make pretty good eating for a hungry little squirrel.", "Wasn't that a great thing to make a fuss about?"]
["Still there is one point that has not been touched upon, and that is, that it is not to be supposed that all of those seedling roots from the seed of our hardiest apples will be hardy.", "You may ask why?"]
["But remember that we have the Hibernal as a scion above those roots, and that is the best apple wood to root from the scion that I know of.", "Some may ask, why not use the Virginia crab?"]
["JENS A. JENSEN, ROSE CREEK.", "Why not grow evergreens in the place of willows?"]
["Vines and Their Uses.", "Have you taken any photographs of your garden, its individual flowers, or wild flowers for our photographic contest?"]
["There is the weak point in this seedling business for Minnesota, I think.", "But the apple orchards of Minnesota, if you are not all getting the good results that you want from your orchards, if you are not all getting a full crop, what is the reason?"]
["Then in that time of the year we are very busy and liable to have some things neglected, and that seems to be the one that is almost always neglected.", "Mr. Brackett: Would you advocate the extensive planting of apples in this climate?"]
["Mr.", "Older: Where you have an orchard ten years old, is it best to seed it down or still continue to cultivate it?"]
["What is the best in this country?"]
["It seems to me that is as near right as I could recommend.", "Mr. Hansen: What distance apart ought those apple trees to be?"]
["Older: Another question along that line.", "Suppose we concede that a young orchard ought to be cultivated until it gets eight or ten years old, then which is the best when you seed it to clover to cut the clover and throw the hay around the trees for a mulch or just take the hay away, or what?"]
["If the hay is used and the barnyard manure is taken to the orchard that would fill the bill pretty well.", "Now, the distance apart?"]
["If you run the rows north and south and put them thirty feet apart, and sixteen feet or a rod apart in the row, with a view to taking out every other tree, you might have to go under bonds to take them out when they are needed to come out (laughter), or else you would leave them there until you hurt your other trees.", "If you would take out every other tree when they get to interfering after several years, eight or ten years, you can grow a double crop of apples in your orchard, but if you do the way you probably will do, leave them right there until they get too close, you will-- Mr. Hansen: Spoil all of them?"]
["Then the next orchard we put out on the farm was twenty-four feet by fifteen or sixteen feet in the row, the rows twenty-four feet apart.", "Are there any other questions?", "Mr. Brackett: Do you think a Wealthy orchard under thorough cultivation, making a rank growth, do you think it is as hardy as an orchard seeded down, and do you think that a Wealthy orchard would blight more than other kinds?"]
["Mr.", "Older: What do you consider the best to seed down with, clover or alfalfa?"]
["Mr.", "Older: Which kind of seeding down would you prefer, what kind of clover?", "Would you want the Alsike clover or sweet clover for an apple orchard?"]
["Mr.", "Older: If you are going to mow it, why not mow the sweet clover same as the other?"]
["I didn't know there was a gopher within a mile, and in one night he made four mounds in the middle of my strawberry bed.", "Mrs. Glenzke: Did you ever try poisoning them?"]
["I am most successful in catching them in a trap.", "Mr. Brackett: Have you got any pocket-gophers that do not make mounds?", "Do you understand that?"]
["Like all winter varieties it is slow to come in bearing but yielding heavily when it does bear, whenever other varieties do.", "Let us not lose sight of this excellent fruit in our desire to produce something new and original.", "How May the State University and the Horticultural Society Best Co-Operate?"]
["It seems we should have more land in the early future, and we may ask for your co-operation in convincing the powers that be that such increase of territory is necessary.", "How many members have you?"]
["Here is the next problem.", "Who are the people that are going to take your places?", "Who is to have a gold watch given him fifty years from now--or given to her fifty years from now?", "This thing is to go on, and how?"]
["At the Devils Lake Nursery we had a 400-bushel per acre potato crop protected only by the blocks of nursery stock, whereas the yield in the vicinity was from nothing to fifty bushels per acre--and I believe if Mr. Andrews will inquire into the location of the good apple crops about Faribault he will probably find they were saved by similar shelter protection, or the natural lay of the land.", "Mr. Kellogg: What is your best windbreak?"]
["Of course, they are held at a higher price, but they make a good windbreak because they are easily grown and are perfectly hardy to stand the dry atmosphere and the hot winds.", "[Illustration: American Elm windbreak at Devil's Lake, N.D.] Mr. Kellogg: What is the reason there are so few of them really blue?"]
["I believe it is the dry atmosphere and the intense sunlight that causes the blue, because the red cedar in North Dakota, the native red cedar, is really a silver cedar and has a blue sheen, or rather, a silver sheen.", "A Member: How large do the trees have to be to be of benefit?"]
["[Illustration: Mountain Ash windbreak at Devil's Lake, N.D.] A Member: I want a shelter mostly for apple trees.", "Would it be five or six years before I receive any benefit, or seven or eight years?"]
["If you are going to do that, don't put the shelter too close to the apple trees, which is a very common fault.", "A Member: How much distance would you allow for the roots?"]
["The finest tree in the plantation is the Austrian pine, and if it continues to do as well as it has the last three or four years I think the Austrian pine is going to be a very valuable pine for shelter-belt.", "Mr. Kellogg: Have you tested the Douglas spruce?"]
["The distance north and south relatively is not so important with reference to growing trees as to get them from too far in the humid district.", "Mr. Kellogg: Do you find any trouble with too much protection for orchards?"]
["Of course, we may lose a crop with a spring frost all right when northern protection might save it, but with us up in our country if we have a good spring frost it is usually heavy enough to catch them anyway.", "[Illustration: Norway Poplar windbreak at Devil's Lake, N.D.] I have a question here: How long should a shelter-belt be cultivated?"]
["Of course, if you set your trees a great distance apart where there is nothing to protect them from the burning sun, and the ground bakes and dries, then you must cultivate or mulch, but I think cultivation much better than mulching.", "Another question: How many rows of trees make a good windbreak?"]
["Two or three rows of evergreens, planted not further than eight feet apart and with joints broken, probably makes as good a windbreak as the twenty rows of deciduous trees and take less ground.", "Mr. Horton: Wouldn't you have an open space in those trees?", "You wouldn't put them all together?"]
["Mr. Horton: Would you have an open space outside of those twenty trees for the snow to lodge in?"]
["They are more hardy, and they make a better protection, and as far as wood goes from the golden willows you get nothing except branches unless it is the white willow.", "I have another question here: What would you plant around the garden?"]
["Mr. Kellogg: I had barberry, and I dug it all up.", "Mr. Maher: It spread too much?"]
["Mr. Maher: Yes, sir.", "Mr. Richardson: Is the mulberry hardy with you?"]
["Mr. Maher: Yes, sir.", "Mr. Huestis: How would the golden elder do as a hedge?"]
["Mr. Huestis: Do you know whether the mulberry is hardy in Minnesota or not?"]
["Mr. Maher: The Tartarian honeysuckle and several varieties of the bush honeysuckles are splendid, and they are hardy and will grow anywhere.", "A Member: Did I understand some one to say that the mulberry was not hardy?"]
["To the south and west of this picture were irises and Oriental poppies in all the gorgeous coloring of the Orient, with a small space on the west where hundreds of pansies nodded their lovely faces to the stately blue larkspurs.", "Are we sure, as has been said, that God forgot to put a soul in flowers?"]
["A DISCUSSION LED BY E. W. RECORD, MARKET GARDENER, BROOKLYN CENTER.", "A Member: I want to ask if many put salt on asparagus?"]
["After you get through cutting, it is pretty hard work to get in there and clean them out.", "Do you find it the best way to hoe them after you get through cutting?"]
["By the time the weeds come up the second time, it is time to quit cutting.", "Mr. Baldwin: How deep do you put the plant below the surface in transplanting?"]
["As soon as it comes up it starts to get crooked.", "Mr. Baldwin: You mean to say that putting manure on top makes the asparagus crooked?"]
["If your bed is very old you are liable to cut some of your crowns rather than to keep the weeds out.", "A Member: Your manure would be all gone then?"]
["I can't say it was the manure that did that, only it looks that way.", "A Member: How would you start a new planting?"]
["A Member: Wouldn't fertilize the first season?"]
["I would fertilize my asparagus ground two years.", "A Member: I mean in preparing your patch for the new planting?"]
["The second year you can harrow it any way you want to.", "A Member: Common corn land, is that fit for raising asparagus?"]
["A Member: Will it improve that land by fertilizing with top dressing?"]
["A Member: The heavy land I suppose wouldn't be good for it?"]
["A Member: You see he couldn't get in there.", "A Member: What fertilizer is good?", "Is bone meal good?"]
["Bone meal is good.", "Mr. Crawford: Can you raise asparagus successfully in the shade or a partial shade?"]
["Mr. Record: I don't think it is a very good place for asparagus.", "A Member: I would like to ask if a person on clay soil could use sawdust to work in?"]
["That will loosen up the ground some, but when it is turned over, of course, it will harden up again if there comes a good hard rain on it.", "A Member: How many years have you maintained a bed?"]
["You loosen up the bottom and put your plants evenly over the ground and put in a little dirt, and if you have it a little barnyard manure.", "Mr. Miller: I suppose the idea of putting that in the bottom is that it is so hard to cultivate the manure on the top without doing as you mentioned?"]
["It will be seen that while there is no question as to the fact of varieties running out, that they differ a great deal in this respect, and it is only through a knowledge of the facts covering each variety, or at least the varieties of each species, that would enable a grower to know what to do in order to keep a variety up to the highest standard.", "Mr. Kellogg: What is the matter with the old Wilson strawberry?"]
["Mr. Kellogg: It can be found in eastern catalogs now.", "Mr. Waldron: Isn't it as good now as it was?"]
["I know that has been referred to as an instance of deterioration of variety.", "Mr. Kellogg: Is there such a thing as a pedigreed strawberry plant that is taken from runners?"]
["He did so and that was the result, the best result that I have ever known.", "The President: How many years ago?"]
["Here we are able to achieve exact results as they very seldom disappoint us as to color or time of blooming as some other plants do.", "Have you tried planting your bulbs with any of the ground cover plants that will take away the bare look that most bulb beds have?"]
["Now to the new ones.", "And the question naturally comes, why any new ones?", "With over 2,000 varieties shouldn't we be satisfied?"]
["They are the most lying vegetable on the face of the earth.", "May I ask if Mr. Peterson, of Chicago, is here?"]
["You see some of the Peterson seedlings listed in other people's catalogues, but I don't have one myself.", "A Member: What kind of varieties would you suggest for the ordinary home garden, best dozen varieties?"]
["I don't know his others, but Felix Crousse is undoubtedly the best of its type in the red.", "A Member: Have you tried out the Baroness Schroeder?"]
["I would say that the Madame Emile Lemoine is finer.", "A Member: Do you advise spraying for them?"]
["Mr. Harrison: Some varieties will bloom and some won't.", "You have got to punish the whole on account of the few?"]
["If I have a two-year-old plant that is blooming in a section I keep it and follow it up.", "Mr. Harrison: Any special rule about multiplying or dividing?"]
["There are now two questions to be answered.", "First, what kind of covering?", "Second, how much?"]
["Mr. Hawkins: We have a question box and would be glad to have any one use it, or rise and ask your question, and we will endeavor to answer it and give our experience along that line.", "Mr. Horton: What would you advise for plants that are infected with aphis?"]
["You understand the finer the particles the quicker it commences to dissolve.", "A Member: Where can ground bone be obtained?"]
["If you separate them it will add vigor to your plant, and the flowers will do better.", "I would like to ask what success you have had with growing tritoma, the flame flower?", "Have you had any difficulty in raising them?"]
["Mr. Hawkins: Mrs. Gould, can you give us any enlightenment?"]
["I know you have to take them up in the winter and store them like gladiolus, and they do not require very heavy soil.", "Mrs. Countryman: Will yucca filamentosa ever blossom in a garden in St. Paul?"]
["Mr. Hawkins: I have had two growing three years, and I never have seen the color of a blossom yet.", "A Member: What kind is that?"]
["I have had them two or three years in succession but not on the same stalk.", "Mrs. Countryman: Do you cover them winters?"]
["It comes in many shades, from white to deep crimson, blooms from the 15th of May to the 1st of July and makes a beautiful showing.", "In regard to iris, did any one have any trouble with their iris coming a little ahead of time last year and being frozen?"]
["I don't think it was because they were ahead of time; it was because of the frost.", "Mr. Hawkins: What would you recommend?"]
["Mrs. Sawyer: Ours weren't on a southern slope, pretty near level, rather north than anything else, and they got frozen.", "A Member: What causes the rot in the iris?"]
["The Siberian and many of the fibrous rooted iris will stand a great deal of water.", "A Member: Does the German?"]
["Mr. Hawkins: This would prove to you that the bulb takes enough water to support it and doesn't need any more because it rests on the top and basks in the sun.", "Has any one tried anything new in the garden that will stand our climate?"]
["A Member: I would like to ask about the trollius.", "Mr. Hawkins: Has any one had experience in raising trollius?"]
["These are three of the best flowers of the garden, and we ought to have some certain way of keeping them.", "A Member: Have you ever tried mulching them with corn stalks?"]

["Mr. Moore: What variety do you raise?"]
["I grew the first generation of cabbages, and the second generation I took over into the radishes because I wanted to treat them there.", "Mr. Rasmussen: Did you say the same fly attacks the onion and the cabbage?"]
["The type of leaf is entirely different, and on the cabbage you are apt to burn them with the sodium arsenite while the lead arsenate will give you practically the same result.", "Mr. Goudy: The cabbage butterfly, does that come from the same maggot?"]

["\"What's the good of looking forward?"]
["That's my motto.\"", "But you think with me; it _is_ all up with us?"]
["There was silence for a moment, and then Cadbury spoke, but in an altered voice.", "Do you mean to say that you want me to leave your name out entirely?"]
["Cadbury stood forward.", "\"So you are responsible for this, Cadbury?"]
["I mean, I was bicycling.\"", "Did you steal it, then, or buy it?"]
["After you'd run over it?"]
["And who cooked it?"]
["\"Cadbury, Cadbury!", "how dare you put forward such a story as this?"]
["Further examination failed to make Cadbury contradict himself; but to certain enquiries he politely declined to furnish an answer.", "\"Was any boy with you at the time who can bear witness to your story?", "\"Will you give me this woman's address, that I may send for her?"]
["\"The cowardly young toad!", "Had to do with it, you say?"]
["By the way, where is he?\"", "Where indeed?"]
["I'd heaps rather!", "You hear, Brady?"]
["said Simmons.", "How, Lew?"]
["And that will be something gained,\" said Simmons.", "Mason, will you captain us?"]
["\"Jack Brady must be captain,\" said Bacon firmly, and all agreed with him.", "However could we have forgotten him?"]
["\"At your service,\" said Jack merrily, and, breaking off his conversation with Trevelyan and Vickers, he joined the group of day-boys.", "\"Brady, have you heard that they've dragged us into this row?", "That our half's stopped along with the boarders'?"]
["\"None of you?"]
["It'll soon be over and forgotten.\"", "Will it?"]
["Simmons and Bacon fairly danced with malicious satisfaction, whilst Armitage and Mason chuckled grimly.", "\"What'll they do?"]
["\"We shall too if the joke once reaches West,\" said Jack.", "Don't you think you might wind up the trick now, and let them in?"]
["We ought to, for we've been at it nearly half an hour.", "And you others--Brady, Ethel, Lucy, et cetera--you've all got your books ready?"]
["What was your job, Armie?"]
["And without waiting for permission he did so.", "Now, then, where is everybody?", "\"Why, Hallett outside?", "What's the meaning of this?"]
["Do you think perhaps they didn't hear the bell, sir?"]
["However, the rudiments of school honour forbade their furnishing the master with an account of the occurrence, and they had to content themselves with breathing dark threats to those day-boys who crossed their path in the frantic rush to the book-room.", "At sight of that rush a few of the milder spirits, such as Hughes and Frere, held their breath in dreadful foreboding, while the unconscious Mr. Peace roared: \"Now, then, how long do you mean to stay in there?"]
["I mark every boy who isn't in his place when it stops!", "Do you hear me?"]
["\"No,\" responded Cadbury, without thinking.", "Then, poking his head out, \"What are we to do, sir, please?"]
["I wish to goodness we knew who it was!", "A reng-lidder?"]
["An' I wait.\"", "\"What d'ye mean, Harey?"]
["The day-boys were prepared for his vagaries, but the boarders were perplexed and bewildered by his conduct.", "Was he partisan or traitor?"]
["You might do worse than strive to attain to this.", "Does anyone know where Trevelyan minor is?"]
["He looked up at sound of the key, and the sight of the small, red-haired urchin, seated disconsolately on a globe within, and swinging his short legs, evoked a question.", "\"What has that lad been doing, Mr. Anderson?"]
["No, sir; it was Brady.", "\"Indeed?", "And what business had he to take the law into his hands?"]
["We're going to be friends all together, the whole boiling of us, before we've done!\"", "Think so?"]
["\"Hullo, Hannah!", "Having a pillow-fight with an overcoat, for fault of a live enemy, eh?"]
["Could you--\" But there Jack stopped short, for Hannah had broken into his sentence with a jerky little sniff which he felt pretty sure was a stifled sob.", "\"Why, my good Hannah, what's up?"]
["It's worse than living in a monkey-house.\"", "\"Have you ever tried that, Hannah?"]
["\"That's a bad business,\" said Jack, looking grave.", "Then your father has been a gardener?"]
["said Jack.", "\"It seems so, doesn't it, sir?"]
["But what do you think?"]
["\"I'm sure I'm awfully sorry about it,\" responded Jack feelingly.", "But--but--but keep up your spirits, and who knows what may turn up?"]
["Now then, you fellows!", "cried Jack, bursting into the school-room like a frolicsome whirlwind, \"who said I wouldn't get leave?"]
["Let you go?"]
["So you've let the whole lot of us in for it, young man?"]
["What more is required?\"", "\"What do you mean, Brady?"]
["\"Look here, I can't understand it!", "What makes you all so beastly to the day-boys--to my pals?"]
["They came to Brincliffe without the least idea of any unfriendly feeling, and you hated them before you'd seen them or heard their names.", "Is that fair--straight--English?"]
["Where's the fun in this constant worrying of each other?"]
["I'm not in a comic mood, and can't make you laugh, like Cadbury, and I haven't Vickers's gift of the gab.", "But wasn't last Friday's lesson enough?"]
["Chaff them if you like--I fancy they'd think there was something fishy if we didn't--but no tricks, if you please.\"", "What if they start them on us, Hallett?"]
["\"I caught Lucy pasting the leaves of my _Delectus_ together,\" murmured Grey, looking at the ceiling.", "And how many things have you done to them?"]
["Vick, will you hand Grey your india-rubber?"]
["\"And a noble one\"--here he put on the \"West voice\".", "\"Have you thought of it in that light, my boy?"]
["You and your dear Green and the rest can have the whole glory and honour of the pots and the barrows to yourselves.", "We won't fight for them, will we?"]
["Jack almost held his breath.", "Would the boys refuse or accept them?"]
["Mason put forward his thumb and finger, then hesitated and looked at Jack with a twinkle in his eye.", "Now, shall I, Brady?"]
["Anyhow, here I am, and I'll ask three questions and then sit down.", "First\"--and up came one finger--\"Isn't this the jolliest supper we've ever had?"]
["But a speech was quite beyond Jack at that minute.", "I say, sha'n't we beg the release of the March Hare?"]
["\"Well, give it me quick, then,\" said Jack, laughing.", "Whatever is it?"]
["You'll never have it again.", "\"Well, what was it, then?"]
["When two things are made into one thing, you can't speak of them any longer as 'both'; can you?"]
["They see that other terrible dangers must also be coming out of the east, and that we People of the Little Hills lie in their path.", "How many more can we withstand, and live?"]
["said Bawr, quick to see what dangerous wanderings might be spared to the tribe by this plan.", "When will you go?"]
["I could not stay with the tribe, and wait.\"", "You think I need help?"]
["And, snatching the girl to her feet, he crushed her for a moment vehemently to his great breast.", "But why,\" he went on, \"did you follow me so secretly all day?"]
["Gr\u00f4m looked at the girl with piercing anxiety such as he had never known before.", "Can you run, very fast?"]
["But Gr\u00f4m hesitated, fearing lest annoyance should befall A-ya if he left her alone with his enemies.", "And the girl, Chief?"]
["Mawg shifted his attention to him.", "What do you want of me?"]
["In no way lacking courage, but failing in will and steadiness, in a dozen seconds Mawg involuntarily shifted his gaze, and looked down at the lions.", "What do you want of me?"]
["said the girl curtly.", "But why?"]
["An hour later, when the first pallor was spreading, she awoke with a cry of fear, and clung to Gr\u00f4m's arm, shuddering strongly.", "But--what is it?"]
["she answered, like a child.", "What were you afraid of?"]
["she answered, sitting up and shaking the hair from her eyes, and staring out fearfully over the gray transparent plains.", "Why should you fear Mawg?"]
["\"Am not I your man?", "And am not I always with you?"]
["Their eyes were wide as they told of the countless myriads of the Bow-legs who were pouring into the head of the valley, led by Mawg and a gigantic black-faced chief as tall as Bawr himself.", "Are they as many,\" asked Gr\u00f4m, \"as they who came against us in the Little Hills?"]
["Then she hesitated, and shut her eyes.", "Should she obey, yielding to her fate?"]
["In half a dozen cautious, groping steps he was among them, and sank down by A-ya's side, clutching her to him to stop her trembling.", "What are we to do now?"]
["In a flash the meaning of it came to her.", "What do you suppose was chasing it, Ook-ootsk?"]
["When the anxious warriors arrived before the cave, they were amazed at the hilarity which they found there--and inclined, at first, to resent it, being something to which they had no clue.", "What were all the old fools doing, dancing and cackling about the fire, and wasting good meat by poking it into the fire on the ends of sticks and spears and arrows?"]
["They both smelled it doubtfully, tasted it, broke into smiles, and devoured it, smacking their bearded lips.", "Did _you_ do this, girl?"]
["Can't go in _these_ trees!", "Why not?"]
["whispered A-ya.", "Where can we go?"]
["The eddy had become but a writhing nest of crocodiles.", "It was hardly worth while wasting arrows, you see?"]
["Do you suppose those swimming beasts with the great jaws can get at us here?"]
["I am just trying to think,\" he answered, \"how to make this thing take us where we want to go.", "If the water is not too deep, couldn't you push with your long spear?"]
["His eager desire now was to get back home and put his new scheme into execution.", "Where are we going now?"]
["\"Before they come,\" said Bawr, dropping his great craggy chin upon his breast, \"the People of the Caves will be trodden out.", "Whither can we escape from such foes?"]
["As he studied out this problem, and urged the warriors to their utmost effort on the heavy and awkward pole-paddles, he kept puzzling all the time over the great mystery.", "What was it that swept even the mighty mammoths before its face?", "How should he name the Fear?"]
["To reach the refuge of the hills across the march of those maddened hordes was obviously impossible.", "Were his people to be forced back into the swamp, to resume the cramped and ape-like life among the branches?"]
["A-ya grabbed him by the arm.", "What is it?"]
["There was but one possible way of escape left open, and that was straight ahead.", "But would the crust continue to uphold them?"]
["The sad face of her friend troubled her; it moved her conscience that she did not deeply share in her anxiety.", "When they came from Domr\u00e9my, she had relied on Jacqueline: there was safety in her counsel,--there was wisdom in it: but now, either?"]
["\"You could help it before.", "Why, Elsie?"]
["Are you Jacqueline?\"", "Am I not?"]
["How is it, Elsie?"]
["not unhappy, Elsie.\"", "Thinking of Leclerc all the while?", "\"Of him?"]
["I thought it was this business in Meaux.\"", "\"Gloomy?"]
["I need work for that no longer.\"", "What is that, Jacqueline?"]
["I seem to, Jacqueline.", "\"Have I any cause for wretched looks, then?"]
["exclaimed Jacqueline, as though she almost hoped this of her dear companion.", "But where?"]
["I do not understand.", "You would not think the Truth worth buying at the price of your life?", "My life?", "Or such a price as he pays who--has been branded to-day?"]
["Oh, I wish that I could get you back to Domr\u00e9my!", "What is going to come of this?"]

["Incline a gracious ear to me, And bid me not despair.", "If thou rememberest each misdeed, If each should have its rightful meed, Lord, who shall stand before thee?"]

["He has sold himself to the Devil, you see.\"", "Mazurier?"]
["My uncle is dead: must I not secure my possessions?--for I am no longer a poor man; I cannot afford to let my life fall into the hands of those wolves.\"", "\"Mazurier retracted?"]
["He only does not believe that whosoever will save his life, in opposition to the law of the everlasting gospel, must lose it.\"", "\"Oh, do you remember what he said to John,--what he prayed in that room?"]

["Victor, you could not desert it.", "\"How can I tell, Jacqueline?"]
["But with my own eyes I saw him walking at liberty in streets where liberty for him to walk could be bought only at an infamous price.\"", "Is there such danger for all men who believe with John Leclerc, and with--with you, Victor?"]

["Yes,\" Victor replied, more troubled than scornful,--\"yes, and allowed himself to be led at last.", "But if you should go away\"---- \"Would not that be flying from danger?"]
["Nay, might it not be doing with your might what you found to do, that you might not be led into temptation?"]
["Oh, if we could go, as Elsie said, back to Domr\u00e9my,--anywhere away from this cruel Meaux!\"", "Have you, then, gained nothing, Jacqueline?"]
["Promise me, Jacqueline,\" he exclaimed, eagerly, as though he felt himself among defences here, with her.", "What shall I promise, Victor?"]
["\"'Whosoever believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live,'\" she answered, with lofty voice, repeating the divine word.", "\"What is our life, that we should hold it at the expense of his Truth?"]
["Forsake me not.\"", "Victor, has He not said, who can best say it, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'?"]
["Having said these words, the face of the young man emerged wholly from the eclipse of the former shadow.", "What is this?"]
["Only let me have it to believe that my life is dear to Jacqueline, and I shall not be afraid then to lose it, if that testimony be required of me.", "Shall we not stand side by side, soldiers of Christ, stronger in each other than in all the world beside?", "Shall it not be so, Jacqueline?"]

["The word she spoke was, \"I can be true to you, Victor.\"", "Won hardly by a word: too easily, you think?"]
["Whatever excess of wonder she may have felt was not communicated.", "How know I that _she_ marvelled at her lover's choice, though all the world might marvel?"]
["He was secretly disquieted, secretly afraid to trust himself, since this defection of Martial Mazurier.", "What did hinder them?"]
["Mazurier had something to do in the matter of reconciling his conscience to the part he had taken, in his recent opportunity to prove himself equally a hero with Leclerc.", "He had recanted, done evil, in short, that good might come; and was not content with having done this thing: how should he be?"]
["Alas!", "and was _his_ hour the extremity of another's weakness, not in the elevation of another's spiritual strength?"]
["You have not gone deep into these matters; you have made acquaintance only with the agitated surface of them.", "_He_ also had been beguiled,--ah, had he not?"]
["He acknowledged freely, with a fatal candor, that, until he came to consider these things in their true light, when shut away from all outward influences, until compelled to quiet meditation beyond the reach and influence of mere enthusiasm, he had believed with Leclerc, even as Victor was believing now.", "He could have gone on, who might tell to what fanatical length?"]
["With such confident prophecy, Mazurier left the young man.", "His visit was brief and hurried;--no duty that could be waived should call him away from his friend at such a time; but he would return; they would speak of this again; and he kissed Victor, and blessed him, and went out to bid the authorities delay yet before the lad was brought to trial, for he was confident, that, if left to reflection, he would come to his senses, and choose wisely--between God and Mammon?"]
["\"He does not come,\" said Jacqueline, at length.", "Did you think it was he, when I came up the stairs?"]
["Love had opened wide her heart,--and Elsie, weak and foolish though she might be,--Elsie, her old companion, her playmate, her fellow-laborer,--Elsie, who should be to her a sister always, and share in her good-fortune,--Elsie had honorable place there.", "Could anything have happened, Jacqueline?"]

["It has been said that the chief element of Hume's mental power was skepticism; and, singular as it may appear, his doubts about what are deemed the vital interests of humanity gave a charm to his record of her political vicissitudes; while he made capital of touching \"situations,\" he displayed his own strength of intellect; but, with all this, did not write complete and authentic history.", "And when analyzed, what was the _animus_ of Gibbon's elaborate chronicle?"]

["Kelson, feeling the night air cold, drew his overcoat tightly around and the others followed suit.", "Then Curtis said-- \"Do you really think there's anything in it, Leon?"]

["When Hamar had concluded his address, the anticipations of the three as to how it would be answered, or whether it would be answered at all--were such that they were forced to hold their breath almost to the point of suffocation.", "If the Thing _could_ speak what would its voice be like?"]
["To acquire the secrets of Black Magic, all you have to do is to agree that during a brief period--a period of a few months, you will live together in harmony; that you will make use of the powers you acquire to the detriment of all save yourselves; that you will never allow your minds to revert to anything spiritual; and--that you will abstain from--marrying.\"", "And if we succeed in carrying out the conditions?"]
["[Illustration: THE INITIATION] \"Then,\" the voice replied, \"you will retain free, untrammelled possession of your knowledge.\"", "For how long?"]

["Unlimited wealth and influence.", "And health?"]

["How much have you, Leon?\"", "How much have you?"]
["\"I might manage a dollar,\" Hamar said ruefully, as the prospect of a good meal all to himself, at his favourite restaurant, faded away.", "Where shall we go?"]
["It still reeked of stale drink and tobacco.", "What's the good of coming to a place like this?"]
["He appeared to be listening.", "What's up with you?"]
["\"They're playing cards, that's all,\" Curtis said.", "Can't you hear them?"]
["Kelson soliloquized; \"breakfast is what we are particularly anxious for--but I suppose that is out of the question in a dive!\"", "Then why did you come here?"]
["How odd!", "Why odd?"]
["Evidently fate intended us to meet.\"", "Do you believe in fate?"]
["Well, then, go into the room over there,\" the girl cried, pointing in the direction of a half-open door, \"and breakfast will be brought you in half a jiffy.", "Who's that playing cards?"]
["How do you know any one is playing cards?"]
["You can't see through walls, can you?"]
["\"By all means,\" Curtis at once exclaimed.", "What do you play?"]

["The men were overwhelmed.", "What are you, anyway?"]
["\"We would make it our business to have a scene first.", "Why not come to terms?"]
["Farmers, indeed!", "Why don't you call yourselves parsons?"]
["As they sauntered across Pacific Avenue, in the direction of Californian Street, Kelson suddenly gave vent to a whistle.", "What the deuce is wrong with you?"]
["Seen your grandmother's ghost?"]
["It takes that form with you, and the form of card tricks with Ed--with me nothing so far.\"", "But what shall I do?"]
["How can I benefit by it?", "How can't you?"]
["All San Francisco will be at your mercy--God knows who'll escape!", "Now?"]

["I have merely to call at the house and tell his wife.\"", "And what good will that do you?"]
["I would do anything to injure them.", "You are a Socialist?"]
["That wouldn't help you,\"--and Kelson laughed.", "Could I count on you not molesting me again if I were to pay you?"]
["You could.", "Do you ever speak the truth?"]
["Kelson replied, \"When the pawnbroker has just advanced you fifty thousand dollars.", "You call that nothing?"]
["\"'Do you,' he said, eyeing me excitedly.", "'Do you know all about it?"]

["\"'Five hundred dollars when you've advertised three thousand,' I cried.", "'What do you take me for?"]
["Take that \"Rabsidab,\" for instance.", "What is it?"]
["We've done well,\" Kelson ejaculated.", "What's the programme for to-morrow?"]
["the man with the spade called out.", "Are you looking for your skin, for I never saw any one so completely jump out of it?"]
["What's that, then?"]
["Hamar retorted.", "What makes you so hot?"]
["And yet you have such defective sight.", "What makes you say that?"]
["the man laughed, \"yes, there is any amount of it--on your brain, that's the only water near here.\"", "Then you don't believe me?"]

["A tall figure rose to greet me, and then, an angry voice exclaimed, 'Why it's not Herbert!", "Who are you, sir?"]

["\"'And it means,' a bluebell said, stepping perkily out from amidst its fellows, 'that your lover is coming--your lover with a troll-le-loll-la--and--well, if you want to know more ask the gooseberries, the gooseberries that hang on the bushes, or the parsley that grows in the bed,'--and at that all the flowers and trees shrieked with laughter--'Ta-ta-tra-la-la'--and with my ears full of the rude laughter of the wood I awoke.", "What do you think of it?"]
["Quite so,\" said Miss Templeton with an amused chuckle, \"but I shouldn't ask for an interpretation of it if I were you.", "Not for an interpretation of the trees and flowers?"]
["I wish you wouldn't always select that bald spot,\" he said testily, \"I don't want to be everlastingly reminded I'm losing my hair.", "Where do you want me to kiss you, then?", "Gladys argued, \"on the tip of your nose?"]

["Miss Templeton cried aghast.", "Why not?"]
["And those who view their faces, Are heard but seen no more.\"", "Do you mean to say she dreamed all that?"]
["Gladys interrupted.", "Were you able to explain the verses?"]
["In the open doorway of the house, an amused expression in her violet eyes, stood a girl--so wondrously pretty, that at the sight of her Shiel was again overcome, and could only gaze in helpless admiration.", "Do you want to see my father?"]
["\"That was very nice of him,\" Gladys said, looking amused again.", "\"Won't you come in?"]
["Much had to be discussed--arrangements for the funeral, the examination of correspondence relative to the firm, and plans for the immediate future.", "You don't know how my uncle's affairs stand, I suppose?"]
["\"Yes,\" John Martin said, \"I do.", "May I ask if you have any private means at all--or are you solely dependent on what you earn?"]
["John Martin murmured, \"how like Dick!", "Have you entertained the idea of inheriting a fortune?"]
["we won't talk it over now--leave it till after the funeral.", "Are you bent on continuing painting?"]
["He was long enough, however, for Shiel to have another chat with Gladys.", "Do you believe in dreams?"]
["They profess to interpret dreams, and I am anxious to see whether they can.\"", "In Cockspur Street, aren't they?"]
["I have spent most of my life in Paris,\" Shiel said.", "But how could you tell that?"]
["He came over here with me, and we chose this site.\"", "Is he an old man?"]
["Gladys retorted indignantly, seeing that Shiel, who had his ticket to get, was out of hearing.", "\"Do I encourage any one?"]
["An hour later Gladys, looking extremely demure and proper, was rapping with a daintily gloved hand at the inquiry office in the great stone lobby of the Modern Sorcery Company's building in Cockspur Street.", "Have you an appointment, madam?"]
["\"No,\" Gladys replied.", "\"Is it necessary?"]
["London is so hot and stuffy, I detest it.\"", "Do you?"]
["I've just come from there.\"", "Are you by any chance Miss Rosenberg?"]
["\"That's my name,\" the girl replied with a look of astonishment.", "How do you know?"]
["The only thing that troubled him, was that he could not be an aristocrat at the same time.", "But, after all, what did that matter?"]
["Kelson said, noticing with approval that the girl had well-kept white hands, and that her clothes, though not particularly expensive, were _chic_, and up-to-date.", "Do you want me only to interpret this poem, or shall I tell you something about yourself first?"]
["I believe you are inspired by the devil.\"", "Shall I go on?"]
["Leave the path of virtue, and give way to self-indulgence and a craving for everlasting change and excitement, and a miserable ending will be your mead--and has been the mead of all others who have done the same thing.\"", "Then the dream is a warning?"]
["Now I can't wait to say more, I must go.\"", "I asked you,\" Lilian Rosenberg said, as Kelson resumed his seat, \"if the dream was a warning?"]

["I can type and do shorthand,\" Lilian Rosenberg replied eagerly, \"and I can correspond in German and French.", "\"And the salary?"]
["How nicely you keep your hands.\"", "\"I manicure them every day,\" Lilian Rosenberg said; then looking up at him from under the long lashes which swept her cheeks, she added, \"You won't forget to tell Mr. Hamar about me, will you?"]
["\"I've come to ask you the meaning of a dream I had last night,\" she began, inwardly shuddering at the sight of so much pomade and jewellery.", "Yes,\" he said with an encouraging smile, \"what was it?"]
["he exclaimed, eyeing the discomfited Kelson wrathfully.", "\"What in the world have you done to offend the lady?"]
["Well!", "what was I to do?"]
["Mindful of what you said to me a short time ago, I put her entirely off the track; gave her an entirely misleading--and as I thought very pleasant--interpretation of the dream.\"", "What did you say?"]
["Miss Gladys Martin!", "Where does she live?"]
["What sport if she is!\"", "\"Why?"]
["Gladys, I want to confide in you!", "What's wrong, Daddy, dear?"]
["His work as an artist doesn't bring him in enough to keep him in tobacco, and the worst of it is he doesn't seem capable of turning his hand to anything else; I can't see him starve, so I shall have to allow him something.\"", "\"He seemed to me very intelligent,\" Gladys observed, \"couldn't you take him into the Firm?"]
["I want some one who is both business-like and inventive--some one young, brilliant and reliable.\"", "You couldn't sell out I suppose?"]

["Do you want to see me?"]
["Which was the tree he spoke about?\"", "\"This one,\" Gladys exclaimed, walking up to an elm, and patting it with her hand, \"but you surely don't believe what he said, do you?"]

["Are they ours?"]
["I certainly consider we've a right to keep them,\" her father said, \"since we've found them ourselves on our own property, but I suppose, legally, they are treasure trove and ought to be given up.", "Then surely the Government would pay us something for them, wouldn't it?"]
["It was all very well for the gardener who was accustomed to it, but it was obviously killing work for Shiel Davenport, and Gladys--as soon as she had overcome a preliminary outburst of laughter--gave vent to her sympathies.", "\"What a shame,\" she exclaimed, \"Father how can you?"]
["\"It's not fit work for you,\" Gladys replied with another reproachful glance at her father.", "When did you arrive, I never heard you?"]
["And an artist is not much good outside his profession.", "Who is?"]
["Shall you still go on painting?", "\"Now that my uncle has died?"]
["I could hardly expect Mr. Martin to take me into his firm.\"", "Aren't you any good at invention?"]
["I,\" Gladys laughed, \"why I've never invented anything in my life, barring a song.", "Nevertheless I'm sure you would be of great help to me,\" Shiel said; \"you would at least criticize my efforts, wouldn't you?"]
["\"I have been painted--twice,\" Gladys observed.", "For the R.A.?"]
["I didn't much care about it, and I grew desperately tired of sitting.\"", "Who painted you?"]
["I couldn't find my aunt,\" she began, \"or she would bandage your hands for you.", "Won't you?"]
["Shiel asked himself the question over and over again before the day was out, and in his sleep, and during the next day, and for many days afterwards.", "Could she tell how much he admired her?", "How much he worshipped her?", "All that he was prepared to do for her sweet sake?"]
["\"I should like to stay here and listen to you singing,\" he said.", "Mayn't I do that?"]
["Then I'll stay here till you return,\" he said, \"I've never been in such a delightful room.", "What do you think of Shiel Davenport?"]
["Then of course he knew.", "\"How?"]
["Gladys said, looking anxiously at her father.", "Whoever do you mean?"]
["He also says that unless I consent to see him, and to listen courteously to what he has to say, he will publicly announce his intention of taking up the wager, at our Hall, in Kingsway, to-night.\"", "Do you think there is any possibility of his having discovered the secrets of your tricks?"]

["Martin?\"", "How dare you, sir?"]
["You want new blood and new capital in your Firm--you would have both in me.", "And the only condition on which you offer me all this is my daughter?"]
["Curtis said, \"crawl through\"--and Hamar, looking as if he by no means appreciated the undignified task of wriggling on his stomach before so many eyes, drew himself as tight together as he could, and squirmed through.", "Does that satisfy you, gentlemen?"]
["I'll bet you anything you like she'll come round and make a tremendous fuss of me.", "Supposing you fall in love with her, how about the compact?"]
["Turning to the audience--at a sign from Curtis--they announced that the whole of Messrs. Martin and Davenport's tricks had been solved to their entire satisfaction, and that Messrs.

["CHAPTER XIV SHIEL TO THE RESCUE Gladys did not feel too happy when she read notices such as these; she could not do other than see in them destruction to her father, and the worst of it all was she could do nothing to help him.", "Who could?", "Who could possibly invent anything as wonderful as the marvels of the Modern Sorcery Company Ltd.?"]

["A cylindrical figure, about seven feet high, without any visible limbs; but which gave me the impression it had limbs--of a sort--if it cared to show them.\"", "You were frightened?"]
["of saffron.", "Are these preparations absolutely necessary?"]
["Indeed, so fearful was Gladys lest her father should hear Shiel, who had managed to elude her outpost, that without meaning it, she greeted him curtly, and, more plainly than politely, gave him to understand that she wished him elsewhere.", "What have you been saying to Shiel Davenport?"]
["But when, at six o'clock, she again stole in to peep at him, and found him lying back on his pillow absolutely still and motionless, and without apparently breathing, she was immeasurably shocked.", "Had he had another fit, or was he dead?"]
["When the entertainment was over, and he was preparing to accompany Gladys as usual to her motor, the thought of her sparkling eyes and animated features again overcame him.", "What shall you advise your father to do?"]
["It is essential he should not be worried with figures.\"", "I suppose my services won't be required much longer?"]
["You see I never thought of this, and I don't know what to say to you.\"", "Won't you give me a chance, just a chance?"]
["Of course, I meet crowds of men, but you see I am not the marrying sort.", "Do you think you would care for me just a bit?"]
["It was, perhaps, good enough for the Victorian era, but it was utterly out of keeping with the present age of hourly progress.", "Who, for instance, wanted to know that at 6 p.m., on the preceding evening, there had been a big fire in New York?", "Was it not far more to the point for them to learn, for example, that at 2 p.m., on that very day, Rio de Janeiro would be partially destroyed by an earthquake; that the Post Office in King's Road, Chelsea, would be broken into by thieves; that Nelson's Monument in Trafalgar Square would be blown up by Suffragettes; or something equally fresh and exciting?"]
["His stealthy approach had given her no chance to escape.", "What is your business?"]
["\"I've come to see your father,\" Hamar said, his eyes resting admiringly on her face and then running leisurely over her figure.", "How is the old gentleman?"]
["\"I can afford to be,\" Hamar grinned.", "Now, do you know what we intend doing before very long?"]
["\"Aren't you?"]
["I intend buying the property, and I shall refuse to renew your father's lease, unless he agrees to give me what I want!\"", "Of course a preposterous price?"]

["If only the Modern Sorcery Company could be cleared off the scenes.\"", "You would, I suppose, feel extremely grateful to whoever cleared them off?"]

["I told your father I would see you, and I meant to stay here till I did.", "And what good has it done you?"]
["I wish you all success,\" she said, \"but I'm afraid you've upset my father dreadfully, and the doctor says excitement is the very worst thing for him and may lead to another stroke.", "You must on no account come here again, until I give you leave.\"", "But I may see you elsewhere?"]

["Will they disappear too?"]
["He ceased speaking, and approaching close to me, tapped my forehead; whereupon there was a blank; and on recovering consciousness, I found myself in bed, feeling somewhat exhausted and very cold.", "You have no recollection of coming to see us, in your pyjamas, about two o'clock in the morning?"]

["Cotton exclaimed, putting his hand to his forehead and leaning against the wall for support.", "Am I ill or dreaming?", "Anything wrong, sir?"]
["Why, what have you done with the prisoner--where is he?"]
["he said to Curtis, \"that all comes of your making a beast of yourself--you would sacrifice Matt and me, for your insatiable craving for meat and alcohol.", "Can't you see it was a trick of the Unknown to make us break the compact?"]

["To give up now would be to break the compact!\"", "Well, why not?"]
["\"Heavens, man, can't you understand!", "Can you form no conception of what failure to keep the compact means?"]

["For another, it was in force up to the beginning of George the Third's reign, when the last case of a person being burned for witchery in England occurred, and since then it has fallen into disuse.\"", "Could it be revived?"]
["Acting on this suggestion, Shiel approached Lilian Rosenberg on the subject.", "What about the spells?"]
["Have you found out yet how Hamar works them?"]
["I never knew what real fear was before I came to Cockspur Street, and for the past few weeks I have been almost too afraid to open my room door, for fear I should see something standing outside.\"", "You have no doubt, I suppose, in your own mind, that the trio practise sorcery?"]
["Do you approve of such proceedings?"]
["Some day, undoubtedly, it will be given us to know, but until that day comes, we had far better leave it alone.\"", "If you think like that,\" Shiel said, \"how can you reconcile yourself to working for these people?", "How can I help myself?"]

["H.V.", "Sevenning, however, thought he knew best--what lawyer doesn't?"]
["But, of course you did not believe the statements of such witnesses.", "How could you?"]
["And they failed to produce the desired effect, simply because their efficacy depended, not on spirit agency, but on human will power; which power one could only too plainly see the society ladies--who had witnessed for the prosecution--did not possess.", "\"It may be asked, why the defendants, if they do not accomplish their spells through black magic, style themselves 'The Sorcery Company'--and so mislead the public?"]
["\"I don't understand,\" she said in rather a faltering voice.", "What have I done?"]
["It was not the thought of losing Shiel that was so painful to her--she might have grown reconciled to that--it was the thought of losing his esteem.", "What, after all, is perjury?"]
["But it was not the opinion of the majority she cared about--it was the respect of the one; the respect she had wilfully and spitefully sacrificed.", "Was it too late to recover it?"]

["Curtis had carefully avoided her since the supper; but she had seen Kelson, and he had looked at her each time he met her as if he yearned to fall down at her feet and worship her.", "Should she attach herself to him for the evening--and run the risk of another quarrel with Hamar?"]
["You shall kiss me at once,\" she said, \"if you promise me one thing.", "And what is that?"]

["Shiel nodded.", "You are not displeased, are you?"]
["I shall know how to act now.", "You will break off your engagement?"]
["Yet the woman was ordinary enough--the type of landlady one sees in all back streets--greasy face, straggling hair, dirty blouse, black hands, bitten fingernails, short skirts, prodigious feet, a grubby child clinging on to her dress and every indication of the speedy arrival of another.", "I suppose you're 'is mother hain't you, mum?"]
["I only wish Gladys were free!\"", "You would raise no obstacle to her becoming engaged to Shiel?"]
["But the marriage must take place within six months' time.", "How could that be arranged?", "Could Lilian Rosenberg be bribed or persuaded into it?"]
["Resolved at any rate to experiment upon these lines, she lost no time in seeking out Lilian Rosenberg, who received her very coldly and was distinctly rude.", "\"What have my affairs to do with you?"]
["Mr. Davenport is surely not as bad as all that!", "When did you see him last?"]
["\"Then you've not heard that he's had a relapse,\" Miss Templeton said, \"and is now in a most critical condition!", "Do you know what it is--the something?"]
["Hamar.\"", "And why, pray?"]
["He has told you?"]
["Has he been as ill as that?"]
["Because,\" she said at last, \"he is in love with her.", "Are you sure of it?"]
["Do you think she cares for him, even as much as that?"]
["Which I am sure it is!", "\"Well, supposing it is--what does it concern me?"]
["If you succeed in doing this the Compact will be broken!\"", "\"That may be,\" Lilian Rosenberg exclaimed, \"but where, pray, should I come in?"]
["If it weren't for this illness--if I could only persuade myself that he isn't as ill as Miss Whatever-her-name-is--said, I shouldn't think twice--I should let things be--but as I feel sure he is really ill--dangerously ill--and the only chance of his recovery lies in the possibility of his marrying Martin--I must deliberate.", "Shall I or shall I not?"]
["Because--because--well there--just like my infernal luck--I love him.", "Could I marry him, I wonder, even if there were no Gladys Martin?"]
["There is a Gladys Martin--and--I can never have Shiel.", "The only question I have to settle is--Shall she have him?"]
["Any pretty face, accentuated by all the allurements of a large mushroom hat and hobble skirt, was enough for Kelson; but when that face belonged to the one girl for whom, above all other girls, he had a colossal weakness, he simply could not feast his eyes enough on it.", "\"Have tea with you?"]
["How can I tell if you are really serious?\"", "Don't I look as if I am?"]
["Will you find out?\"", "How can I?"]
["Have you discovered anything?\"", "Shupposing I have,\" Curtis replied, \"shupposing I haven't--whatch then?"]

["That which at first had lured him on, now seemed to mock him.", "Where was the new life he had promised himself?", "Was it only a vision he had conjured up in his mind?"]
["Was this all?", "Had the human race attained its zenith--was there nothing beyond, nothing to look forward to, and he merely the latest dreamer and enthusiast who was pursuing the same will-o'-the-wisp that others had sought through the ages?"]
["Come what would, he either must go on to the end or accept the humiliation that awaits him who turns back.", "But why was the realization withheld from one so willing--from one who had dared face the world alone?"]
["A sudden revulsion and sickening sense of failure swept over him, crushing and overwhelming him.", "Would the voices never break silence?", "Must he forever ride alone with the sun in his face?"]
["It was incredible, but true, nevertheless.", "For was he not there in the midst of the wilderness with the scent of the sage in his nostrils and the alkali dust on his boots?"]

["I thought, of course, that it was the money she wanted when she finally consented to dance, but I'm not so sure of it now.", "What reason have you for supposing otherwise?"]
["What do you think she did with the heap of gold and silver that was showered upon her by the audience?\"", "What?"]
["_Caramba_--'tis strange!", "\"But what will Padre Antonio say when he hears of it?"]
["Already it had been noted on previous occasions that an overindulgence in _aguardiente_ usually invoked a religious frame of mind in him, but which in Miguel's case resembled rather the groping of a lost soul than the prophetic vision of the seer.", "What of that?"]
["What a sad, weary world this would be if there were only priests and churches in it and men did nothing all day long but say aves and burn candles on altars,\" and Carlos lightly blew a ring of smoke toward the ceiling.", "Ah, yes, perhaps--_quien sabe, amigo mio_?"]
["Ah!", "he continued, wagging his head, and in a tone of bravado and offended dignity, \"you think I can't get home alone, do you?"]

["It was empty.", "_Dios!_ what had happened?"]
["With a note of keenest disappointment in his voice he turned sharply on the driver and impatiently demanded what had become of the little Indian girl that had been placed in his charge.", "\"Little Indian girl?"]
["Merciful heaven!", "what had become of her--Chiquita, his little girl?"]
["Confounded and speechless with amazement, Padre Antonio could only gaze in silence upon the apparition before him.", "Was it possible, or was he only dreaming?"]
["Was this mature woman, this tall and supple and refined and graceful creature his Chiquita, his wild little Indian girl of former years?"]
["And what's more--it never did seem proper that so handsome a woman should live with a priest even though she be his ward and he an old man.", "Handsome?"]
["Instead of being overwhelmed, broken in spirit and utterly cast down by grief and shame as had been confidently predicted, he, much to the disgust of his congregation, went calmly about his duties as though nothing unusual had occurred, referring jocosely to this lark of his madcap ward as he was pleased to term it.", "Lark?"]
["had the Padre lost his senses?"]
["Moreover, the very ones who criticised her most in secret, were usually the first to come to her for advice when in trouble.", "For who was so wise as the strange, beautiful woman?"]
["Save for his presence, the place was deserted; the empty chairs standing about just as their occupants of the previous evening had left them, a proof that he was the first of the guests to be abroad.", "I wonder where Dick is?"]

["No--it can't be!", "What's the matter, Jack?"]
["he cried, ignoring his companion's question and leaning out over the veranda rail, his gaze riveted on the stage.", "Friends of yours?"]

["Do you know,\" he went on, stopping abruptly before his nephew, \"they say that, before you left Newport, you ran your touring-car over the cliff into the sea--a machine that must have cost you fifteen thousand at least!", "\"Well, what if I did?"]
["It required but little discernment on the part of the Mexicans to perceive that the meeting between Captain Forest and his family was not what might be termed particularly felicitous.", "Even Se\u00f1ora Fernandez was quick enough to perceive that things were going from bad to worse, and in an effort to smooth matters, she stepped forward and in her best English said: \"Se\u00f1or _Capitan_, why did you tell me not zat ze ladies were coming?"]
["You have no right to hang a man without a trial.\"", "Say, old punk,\" cried the leader, turning savagely on the Colonel, \"who's a runnin' this show?"]
["The hanging might proceed so far as he was concerned.", "Gentlemen,\" spoke up the Captain, \"what has this man done?"]
["There was only one way to save the prisoner--the use of the same means employed by the lynchers, namely, force.", "Whence could such interference come?", "How could a man single-handed cope with a well-armed body of men of their type?"]
["he roared.", "I would like to know, sir, who gave you authority to shut our mouths?"]
["gasped Blake.", "Where did you come from?"]
["Thank you, Dick, I'll not forget you!", "I--I beg your pardon, Madame,\" he stammered, \"but would you mind telling me your name?"]
["growled Blake, tugging nervously at his beard.", "\"And now, Dick Yankton,\" he continued, confronting him squarely with both feet spread wide apart and his hands thrust to his elbows in his trouser pockets, \"the question is, what's to be done with you?"]
["It is usually a difficult matter to pocket one's pride, especially if one sees ridicule lurking just around the corner, but few men were capable of resisting the charm of Dick's personality for long.", "Come, Jim, be reasonable,\" he said, laying his hand familiarly on Blake's shoulder; \"Bob Carlton saved my life once and now we're quits.", "\"He did?"]
["gasped Mrs. Forest after the last of them had disappeared.", "Have people here nothing to do but murder one another?"]
["Their presence seemed as incongruous with their surroundings as that of some delicate hot-house flower blooming in the midst of the desert.", "Could you have believed it if you hadn't seen it?"]
["\"Is it all real, or are we still dreaming?"]
["\"It's simply incomprehensible after all he's seen of the world,\" replied Bessie.", "\"Did you notice how he enjoyed our discomfiture?"]
["\"Nonsense!", "Jack in love with some half-breed--that dusky beauty in breeches who rides astride, and whom he happened to mention to us?"]
["\"Oh, I don't mean to infer that she's beautiful,\" continued Blanch.", "\"Attractive she may be, but how could anything so common be really beautiful?"]
["You know,\" she added, \"he's not given to talking without a purpose and usually acts even though he lives to repent of it afterwards.", "Why, if he were left here, he might marry from _ennui_, who knows?"]
["Hush!\"", "\"Well,\" he said at length, descending to where they stood, \"how do first impressions of the place strike you?"]
["The sight of Blanch had sent a sudden thrill through him that told him plainly enough how deeply rooted had been his love and that he had not yet succeeded in eradicating it entirely from his heart as he had supposed.", "The spark of the old love still smoldered within him, and would she succeed again in fanning it into flame?"]
["The great harlot world had come to pooh-pooh--to scoff and laugh him out of his convictions, and no one knew better than he did what the mighty power and influence of the great civilized guffaw meant.", "For had he not, during his diplomatic career, seen the primitive man laughed out of his cool, naked blessedness into a modern, cheap pair of sweltering pantaloons?"]
["Do you know,\" he said at length, \"I don't pity you a bit; it serves you right for coming.", "Pity?"]
["\"Do we look like a pair of beggars that have come two thousand miles to crave pity at the feet of the high and mighty Captain Forest?"]
["A strange light came into her beautiful blue eyes, softening the expression of her face; a face that had been the hope and despair of many a man; a face that was not alone beautiful but alive and interesting; a face into which all men longed to gaze and once seen could never be forgotten.", "Who could guess the real motive that prompted her to humble her pride so far as to follow him?", "Was it love or hatred?", "Who could say?"]
["The sound of her full, rich, musical voice, colored with a soft accent that was pleasing to the ear, instantly brought Blanch and Bessie to themselves.", "Perhaps,\" she began again calmly, \"it is because I am poor?"]
["Then perhaps it is because I am an Indian and red, not white like yourselves?", "Are you an Indian, Se\u00f1orita?"]
["thought Bessie.", "But why did the Se\u00f1oritas laugh when they saw me?"]
["Yes, Se\u00f1orita, you love him.", "How do you know I love him?"]
["Why, you have only met me for the first time!", "\"How do I know?"]
["Yes, I love him--love him as you do--love him as you can never love him, Se\u00f1orita!", "What makes you think so?"]
["And should he not love me as I love him, my life will go out of me swiftly and silently like the waters of the streams in summer when the rains cease; my soul will become barren and parched like the desert, and I shall wither and die.\"", "Die?"]
["And no longer able to control herself, she burst into a peal of laughter in which was easily detected the scorn, good humor and pity she felt for her would-be rival.", "Se\u00f1orita,\" said Blanch at length, heaving a sigh, \"who are you?"]
["My father was the Whirlwind, the War Chief of my people.\"", "The Whirlwind?"]
["\"Se\u00f1orita,\" she said at last, \"when one like me stands on the threshold midway between savagery and civilization and compares the crudities and at times barbarities of the one with the luxuries and vices of the other, he often asks himself which is preferable, civilization and its few virtues, or the simple life of the savage.", "Which, I ask, is the greater--the man who tells the time by the sun and the stars or he who gauges it with the watch?", "I have listened to your music and gazed upon your art and read your books, but what harmonies compare to nature's--what book contains her truths and hidden mysteries?"]
["\"Life's usually as tragic as it is comic,\" laughed Chiquita lightly, slowly moving in the direction of the highroad.", "\"It's strange, isn't it,\" she exclaimed, pausing and looking back, \"that a queen and a beggar should dispute the affections of the same man?"]
["the bird had flown.", "Such things were always expedited with such felicitous despatch in those parts of the earth inhabited by civilized men, but here where everybody was equally mad, where chaos reigned, and nobody either recognized or respected beings of a superior order, what could be done to check the headlong career of his nephew who with twenty millions was rushing straight to destruction?"]
["Indeed it was a handsome face, and like many others both in and outside of his particular set, he devoted hours to its preservation.", "What was John, his valet, for?", "To press his clothes and run errands?"]
["With Blanch it was otherwise.", "How could she sleep with the face of Chiquita constantly before her and the pangs of jealousy gnawing at her heart?"]
["Of course Jack, the wretch, was sleeping peacefully--that was the irony of fate!", "What did he know of suffering?"]
["How peaceful it was!", "After all, why was the place so unusual, so different from the rest of the world?"]
["And why, she asked herself, as her thoughts reverted to Chiquita, was this Indian woman so very different from themselves?", "Was there any reason to believe that the queens of Sheba and Semiramis with their tawny skins were any less fair than she, Blanch Lennox, with her rosy, soft white complexion?", "Or Chiquita a shade darker than Cleopatra, the witch of the Nile, whose beauty caused the downfall of Antony and with it the waning power and splendor of ancient Egypt?", "Was her lineage superior to Chiquita's, the descendant of a long line of rulers whose ancestry stretched back into the dim, remote past as ancient as the hills, the record of whose lives and deeds stood inscribed on the ruined temples and palaces scattered throughout the land where they once dwelt at a time when her European ancestors roamed the wilderness half naked and clad in the skins of wild beasts?"]
["True, Chiquita was an exception just as she towered above most women of her race.", "And who were they, that they should criticize--vaunt their superiority in the face of the universal scheme of things?", "Were they really any better?"]
["What was true civilization and culture, any way?", "Who had ever succeeded in defining them?"]
["The man in power who talks of culture may be taken seriously by those of his own race who stand by and applaud his words, but remove him from his home surroundings and place him on a footing of equality with those of a different race and environment and his arguments fail to convince.", "Did the harangues of Louis the Sixteenth's tormentors convince him of the ethical standards of universal justice, or John Brown's sacrifice the representatives of a slave-holding population?", "Which is the most convincing--the example set by the early Spartans, or that of the man who surrounds himself with every luxury and convenience of modern life; the man who reads books and lives in a house and travels by train and automobile, or he who dwells in a tent, who is ignorant of letters, and prefers the slower locomotion of horse and foot?", "Who is the arbiter of fashion?", "The sun shines alike on the just and the unjust, the great world still continues to laugh and goes on its way in spite of men's philosophies, but tear up the map, as the French say, and where are our standards and codes?"]
["It was quite evident that somebody had lied.", "In fact, all men of her race had been lying from the beginning of time, for what, after all, did civilization amount to if it were not convincing?", "Did it ever soothe a wounded heart, stifle the pangs of jealousy, or was it ample compensation for the loss of the great prize of life--happiness?"]
["\"Of course I am,\" returned Blanch, coloring and biting her lip.", "What else should I be thinking of?"]
["Dust and a horse's nose thrust suddenly into Mrs. Forest's face could hardly improve a temper already strained to the breaking point.", "Are people beasts--mere cattle of the fields to be trampled upon by a horse?"]
["replied the horseman, his English colored with a slight accent.", "What are people's eyes for?"]
["cried Blanch and Bessie in the same breath.", "\"How,\" exclaimed Blanch, \"could you expect us to recognize you in that costume?"]
["he asked, changing the topic of conversation.", "\"Did you drop from the clouds?"]
["\"Only a pleasure trip combined with a little exploration on our own account,\" answered Blanch indifferently.", "We hope,\" she continued, \"to emulate the example of the old Spanish _Conquistadores_--some of your ancestors perhaps?"]
["\"We certainly shall avail ourselves of the rare privilege, Don Felipe,\" said Bessie.", "Do you intend stopping here?"]
["\"This is truly the land of surprises.", "I wonder what will happen next?\"", "What can have brought them here, to this out-of-the-way place?"]
["The attractions and fascinations of the Capitol opened his eyes to many things which he had hitherto overlooked, especially, that there are many beautiful women in the world, and always one who is just a little more beautiful than the others if one took the trouble to look for her.", "What had he, Don Felipe Ramirez, who lived and ruled like a prince on his vast estates, to fear from a pretty little half-caste Indian girl?"]
["The latter frequently accompanied Padre Antonio on his charitable missions and thus it chanced that she made Pepita's acquaintance and learned her story.", "We may deaden our souls to the voice of conscience, disavow a belief in destiny and shut our eyes to those forces of the Invisible which, in spite of ourselves, we know to exist, but how is it, that no man ever succeeds in escaping his fate?"]
["His unconquerable love for Chiquita devoured him, gnawed constantly at his heart, and he cursed her--cursed her as only one of his temperament who had suffered as he suffered, could curse.", "What could he do?"]
["Your friends have missed you sadly and have prayed for the day of your return.\"", "Friends?"]
["\"You shall learn shortly for yourself,\" returned Se\u00f1ora.", "How long,\" interrupted Felipe, eager to change the drift of the conversation, \"have the American ladies been here?", "Ah, you have seen them?"]
["They are friends of mine.\"", "You know them?"]
["she exclaimed.", "But what are they doing here?"]
["\"_Caramba!_ but they are grand ladies!", "They say,\" she went on, \"that they are traveling for pleasure, but what pleasure can such delicate, refined ladies possibly find in the desert, I should like to know?"]
["He came here before the others and seemed very much surprised and put out by their unexpected appearance.\"", "Captain Forest?"]
["\"He must be a thoroughbred at any rate,\" laughed Felipe.", "\"Thoroughbred?"]
["He's a great friend of Se\u00f1or Yankton, and--\" she stopped abruptly.", "And what?"]
["Her words acted like fire to tinder.", "Interested in him?"]
["he muttered excitedly.", "\"Are you sure of what you say, Do\u00f1a Fernandez?", "Tell me that it is not true--that it is a lie!\"", "Why, what has come over you, Don Felipe Ramirez?"]
["Surely you cannot--she can be nothing to you any more?", "\"Nothing to me?"]
["and his voice broke.", "What?"]
["You don't really mean to say that you still--love her?"]
["Don Felipe!", "Have you forgotten your self-respect?", "The handsomest, richest man in all Chihuahua running after an Indian--the woman who treated you so shamefully--an ingrate who is unworthy of a love like yours?"]
["What would Don Juan, your father, peace be to his soul, say if he were alive?"]
["she cried in a frenzy of hatred and jealousy.", "How can you possibly love her, Don Felipe Ramirez?", "How can I love her?"]
["In the opinion of every one, she has fallen, degraded herself.\"", "\"Degraded herself?"]
["Only a fortnight ago,\" answered Se\u00f1ora, \"on the great day of the _Fiesta_, she danced publicly in Carlos Moreno's theater.", "\"Chiquita danced in Carlos Moreno's hall?"]
["Don Felipe,\" replied Se\u00f1ora with just the suggestion of a smile, \"all things are possible with a woman.", "But why did she dance?"]
["They say she received three thousand _pesos_ in gold.\"", "Three thousand _pesos_?"]
["What did she do with them?"]
["\"It was not so much her dancing that scandalized the community, for we all know what a wonderful dancer she is.", "Nobody ever danced as she does, and we are willing to give her credit for it, but what did she do with the money?"]
["\"But I have been forgetting my duty; I must prepare a room for you, Don Felipe.", "\"Chiquita danced in public?"]
["he said aloud after Se\u00f1ora Fernandez had disappeared in the house.", "And she interested in this Captain Forest?"]
["Hopeless though this plan seemed, Chiquita might for the Captain's sake, if she really cared for him, act more discreetly than was her wont.", "But what could be expected from a woman in love?", "Who could tell how she would act?"]
["Merciful God!", "was there no justice in this world?"]
["_Dios!_ how she must have looked to him in the regal presence of Blanch, gowned in her stylish traveling costume!", "Don Felipe Ramirez would have kissed the dust from off the hem of such an old garment, but would Captain Forest do the same?"]
["I don't know whether I love you or not,\" it said plainly as words, \"but henceforth you shall be my slave.", "How long have you been there?"]
["\"Only an instant, Se\u00f1orita,\" he replied, raising his hat.", "\"I was wondering,\" he continued, \"whether it would be too much to ask you for one of those roses?"]
["\"I promise,\" said the Captain solemnly, dismounting and holding his horse by the rein.", "\"Indeed?"]
["Any one else but Jos\u00e9 and himself he would have seized with his teeth.", "Perhaps it was her way of approaching and handling him, or was it the subtle influence of that mysterious kinship which exists between the wild things--strange and inexplicable to all but themselves?"]
["He was a present from Count Don Louis de Ortega, of the City of Mexico.", "Count Louis de Ortega?"]
["If nature and convention now swarmed at the Captain's saddle-bow, surely it was no fault of his.", "Had he not burnt his last bridge, snapped his fingers in the face of the world, and turned his back upon it and ridden forth in search of the lost kingdom of Earth?"]
["cried the Se\u00f1ora furiously, stepping out from the shadow of the wall after the Captain had disappeared down the road.", "\"Will she stop at nothing?"]
["she cried, eyeing Chiquita critically.", "\"What is the meaning of this; dressed in your very best?", "Is this the Sabbath, or one of the blessed Saints' days, or perhaps a Palm-Sunday that you should array yourself thus?"]
["when has it become the fashion for young ladies to disport themselves in their best clothes on common, ordinary week days?"]
["she gasped between breaths, clasping her hands and glancing heavenward.", "\"Do such dresses grow upon bushes that they are so easily obtained?"]
["Chiquita, accustomed to the Se\u00f1ora's outbursts, did not deign an immediate reply, but sat quietly fanning herself, a faint smile wreathing her lips; she was thoroughly enjoying the Se\u00f1ora's discomfort.", "What would not the latter give to know something concerning those _pesos_?"]
["ejaculated Chiquita composedly, as though nothing unusual were taking place.", "Is that all you have to say Do\u00f1a Fernandez?"]
["Is that not enough?"]
["The Se\u00f1ora, however, was by no means abashed by Chiquita's indifference, and vigorously renewed the attack.", "So our little ring-dove is in love, is she?"]
["how your tongue runs on!", "Am I not to be allowed to say anything?"]
["\"Perhaps it is well for the world that all people are not so sensible as you are, Do\u00f1a Fernandez,\" and her fan closed with a sudden snap.", "\"So this is the advice you came to give me, Do\u00f1a Fernandez?"]
["Chiquita started.", "Don Felipe here?"]
["The Se\u00f1ora was satisfied with her morning's work; her words had had their effect.", "Besides, had she not had her say--unburdened her soul of many things which she had long been dying to give utterance to?"]
["\"_\u00c1 Dios_, Se\u00f1orita,\" she added sarcastically, her black eyes gleaming with malicious satisfaction as with mock courtesy she bowed and turned, leaving Chiquita silent and motionless, her eyes cast on the ground and lost in thought.", "XIV \"Don Felipe here?"]
["He had always suspected that she never really cared for Don Felipe, and had done his best to break off the engagement before the catastrophe had overtaken the latter; but this was different.", "His knowledge of human nature told him that she had at last met the man worthy of her love, but, he asked himself, would Captain Forest, of a different race and reared under totally different conditions, reciprocate that love?"]
["\"I thought I heard voices,\" he said, seating himself beside her.", "Has any one been here?"]
["She has been giving me some of her advice.", "Advice?"]
["she exclaimed petulantly, looking at him inquiringly.", "_Dios!_ what have I done that everybody comes to give me advice when I have so many other things to think of?"]
["Am I so vain as all that, Padre _mio_, that you should be obliged to remind me of it?\"", "Then why this continual display?"]
["Again he sighed, and Chiquita looking up quickly, saw in his eyes that which she had never suspected.", "Padre _mio_,\" she said at length, lowering her eyes and slowly opening and shutting her fan, \"have--have you ever been in love?"]
["\"So terrible,\" she answered.", "So terrible?"]
["For shame, that you should set such store upon worldly things!\"", "Padre _mio_, you would not have your little Chiquita unhappy, would you?"]
["Again the linnet gave voice to his song, and the cooling breeze sighed among the tamarisk plumes that waved about their heads.", "Do you remember when you first came to me, Chiquita _mia_?"]
["I'm afraid I'm still the little devil that I was!\"", "Padre _mio_,\" she said softly, looking down at him with mischievous lights dancing in her eyes, \"you don't really regret that I have remained what I am, do you?"]
["She gave a little laugh, and tapping him gently on one shoulder with her fan, said: \"Do you know what you are, Padre _mio_?\"", "What, my child?"]
["From that hour, waking or sleeping, the weapon must never leave her.", "XV Who was Richard Yankton?"]
["Of course.", "What man or woman has not, even though they dare not admit it?", "Had he loved too much or too little?"]
["Was he haunted by the fear that some fair, false one might marry him for his fortune, not for himself?", "Or, was his aversion to marriage due solely to the fact that the right woman had not yet arrived?"]
["No wonder the Indian prized the peace and beauty of nature above all else.", "What was his _hacienda_ to this?"]
["You only fainted.\"", "How dare you hold me in your arms?"]
["How dare you kiss me, sir?"]
["She laughed in his face.", "\"A man who single handed held a furious crowd of men at bay as you did--frightened?"]
["\"Well!", "how much longer are you going to stand there?"]
["He turned and gave a shrill whistle.", "Won't you ride?"]
["The gay little songsters were a veritable revelation to them--especially to the Colonel.", "How could such gentle creatures go on singing with such indifference to the future in a land where life was held so cheap and all things so uncertain?"]
["He had come to argue his nephew out of his folly through sheer force of logic and it behooved him to remain as calm as possible during the interview, for his nephew had a most surprising way of answering back and turning the argument against one.", "Tell me,\" he began, \"what possible attraction this country can have for you?"]
["\"Granted for the sake of argument,\" broke in the Colonel, flipping the ash from off his cigar.", "But what about art, science and literature, the real things which stand for civilization?"]
["It is fortunate that man has an outlet through these manifold channels of expression.", "\"They are the best part of our lives so far as they go, but all art and science and no nature, and what becomes of man?", "Have they made the world happy, and is there any immediate prospect of their ever doing so?", "Did the Greeks, who attained the supreme heights in art, find happiness in their art?"]
["The true message can never be delivered to the world until the life for which these things stand is actually lived out, becomes a part of man's daily life.\"", "And you intend to deliver that message, I suppose?"]
["A chorus of laughter, in which were mingled the voices of Blanch and Bessie who had just joined the group, greeted this confession.", "Did you ever hear the like of the conceit?"]
["\"You set an example to the world?"]
["utterly superficial, just like those brilliant women of the great French revolutionary period.\"", "\"I admire your frankness, Jack; but what do you really intend doing?"]
["cried the Colonel, unable to contain himself any longer.", "\"Is this the inane, prosaic existence for which you have given up one of the most brilliant careers the world had to offer a man?"]
["I must _live_ the life they preached.", "Do you understand?"]
["She admired his strength and yet hated him for it.", "Why, she asked herself again, as she did on the day he first imparted his new views of life to her, was she not moved?", "Why was she still unable to thrill at the sound of his words?"]
["The instant man realizes this he will be free.", "\"I know you cannot understand this,\" he continued with a shade of impatience in his voice, \"for what can a lot of slaves like you, the brick and mortar type of man, know of freedom, all that is best and noble in life?"]
["He would bide his time and strike only when the moment seemed propitious.", "The vague rumors which were current concerning Chiquita must have some foundation, else why the continual gossip on every tongue?"]
["Reveal the cause, the hidden well-spring of destiny, and the effect may be predicted with comparative accuracy.", "Can the lamb lie down with the lion?"]
["Clothe human nature in whatever garb you like, at heart it remains the same.", "Was Bessie, the spoilt, pampered child of fashion with her soft, white body, any more fit for a life lived close to nature than Blanch who was naturally strong, sinuous and supple, though so softened by luxury and the overrefinements of civilization?"]
["Much to her astonishment, however, and contrary to her preconceived notions concerning men, she found that she had suddenly lost interest in this particular man for another.", "But why?", "What was the cause of this newly awakened interest in Dick?", "Was it because he was so different from the men she had known, or was it that strong touch of the feminine in him which certain sensitive masculine natures possess; that rare, distinguishing characteristic which is so attractive to men and women alike?", "Did any real affinity exist between them?", "How could it, considering the different conditions and environment in which they had been reared and the width of the gulf that divided them?", "What then was the cause of this attraction which in spite of her efforts to check it, was beginning to become a source of vexation to a woman of the world who had always prided herself on being able to keep herself well in hand?"]
["broke in Bessie from the sofa.", "What is it--a Worth?"]
["Isn't it absurd that I should array myself in these gorgeous gowns to compete with that Indian in her few flimsy calicoes and silks?"]
["\"With us,\" she went on, \"marriage is more a game of intrigue than love; here it is purely one of sentiment.", "Aside from my intrinsic value, what weapon have I to employ against this Indian woman?"]
["\"To think that he of all men should have been the one chosen to show me myself--the only one of us who was strong enough to break away!", "Why was I not able to hold him?", "Why am I not able to come to him now?"]
["\"After the first cup, you might disappear, Bess,\" said Blanch.", "I want to try to find out if he still cares for that Indian?"]
["\"And the little one,\" said Rosita in turn.", "Is she not like a half-blown pink rose?"]
["\"That's just what I have been saying to myself,\" returned Juan.", "What else can he be doing here if he doesn't intend to take one of them back to his _hacienda_ with him?"]
["returned Juan, pulling the end of his thin mustache, yet not in the least disconcerted by her show of temper.", "But supposing, my pearl of a housekeeper, that I bought a neat little _rancheria_--do you know of any one who might care to look after it?"]
["There will then be time enough to look for some one who will allow herself to be beaten on feast-days when you have drunk more _pulque_ than is good for you.", "But _Dios!_ why am I wasting words with you?"]
["Would you leave me without a kiss?"]
["what has come over you, Juan Ramon--has the sunshine gone to your head?"]
["Her riding-habit, her boots and gloves and gray felt hat beneath which were twisted her thick braids of hair, were covered with thin white particles of dust.", "Where is your mistress, Do\u00f1a Fernandez, Juan?"]
["His dream of the _hacienda_ and the fair Rosita might yet come true.", "But how?"]
["He threw the burnt end of his _cigarillo_ on the ground, and, drawing up his feet, stretched himself at full length on the bench--the upper half of his fox-like face appearing just above the edge of his _zerape_.", "_Dios!_ was it not better to sleep and even dream bad dreams, than waking, meditate upon the misfortunes of life?"]
["The greeting which took place between her and Blanch was cordial enough to all outward appearances.", "Considering the tension and delicacy of the situation, the volcanic nature of the two and the intense longing of each to fly at the other and settle their differences then and there, the self-control of the two was commendable in the extreme.", "Do you ride much, Se\u00f1orita?"]
["\"I have always tried to live up to a certain standard,\" replied Blanch.", "And how long have you known him?"]
["as long as I can remember--twenty years, perhaps.\"", "\"Twenty years, and always looked like that and not married to him?"]
["she said, after a short silence.", "Why do you suppose I am here?"]
["Then how could you have lived near him all these years without marrying him?"]
["What have you endured, what have you suffered to make you feel and realize the full significance of love?\"", "Do you imagine,\" asked Blanch in surprise, \"that there is any less of the woman in me because I have been spared the things which you perhaps have been forced to endure, or that one must first suffer before one is capable of loving?"]
["But it seems to me I am better fitted for him than you are; that my love, tempered by my life's experience, must be fuller and deeper and richer than that which you have to offer him.", "What,\" she continued, \"do you really know of life?", "Not the social side of it, of which your life has been so full, but life as it really is?", "Were you born under the open heavens?", "Have you slept on the hard, cold ground, exposed to the weather, or nearly perished of hunger and thirst?", "Have you seen men, women and children starve, or ruthlessly struck down by your side, or nursed them through some terrible scourge like the smallpox?"]
["\"When I lived in the Garden of Eden, in God's world, not man's, is what you mean,\" she replied.", "Do you never have a desire to return to it?"]
["he burst forth.", "How dare you speak of love to me?"]
["\"Have you forgotten Pepita Delaguerra, whom you ruined, for whose death you are responsible?"]
["he laughed.", "\"How could you take me to be so simple, so foolish?"]
["There was a malicious gleam of exultation in his eyes as he saw her draw herself together suddenly and shudder as though struck by a knife.", "What say you to that, Se\u00f1orita?"]
["\"What, dead at my feet?"]
["he replied, recovering his equilibrium.", "Do you think I fear a woman?"]
["he laughed, snapping his fingers.", "You think to kill me?"]
["Craven though his soul might be, he could not be accused of cowardice in the face of danger.", "Besides, what had he to live for?"]
["The hour had come; the circle of death had closed about them, and he knew now for a certainty that it meant either his life or hers; that there was no longer any hope of a reconciliation, no longer room for them both in this life.", "Do you imagine that I fear the threats of a woman?"]
["\"You have been warned,\" she answered quietly, and giving him a last searching look, she turned and left him abruptly.", "Had ever mortal drunk deeper of the cup of humiliation than he?"]
["No, she must be broken completely, humiliated in the eyes of the world, humbled to the dust as he had been humbled; nothing short of that could satisfy him now.", "But how, how was her ruin to be accomplished?"]
["Ah!", "he cried aloud, \"why did she dance; why has she concealed her motive so carefully from the world?"]
["replied Juan lightly, raising his _sombrero_ as he advanced.", "What do you know?"]
["\"Don't worry about what I know; leave that to me for the present,\" answered Juan, his peculiarly cold smile lighting up his face.", "But what will you give to know, Don Felipe Ramirez?"]
["What will I give?"]
["Like Hermes of old his feet seemed to have become suddenly endowed with wings, with the result that his head was coming into dangerous proximity to the clouds.", "_Dios!_ what had come over Se\u00f1or Dick, who was on the best of terms with every man, woman and child and dog in Santa F\u00e9?"]
["The salutations of his friends and acquaintances who greeted him when he walked abroad were left unnoticed; his gaze fixed dreamily on space before him.", "What had happened?", "Had he come into possession of a new mine, or was he engaged in locating one through means of that psychic sense or inner vision of the seer which he seemed to possess?"]
["\"You women are always imagining things which do not exist.", "Have we not often seen the Se\u00f1or like this before?", "Has he not completely spoiled the Se\u00f1oritas of the town with his flowers?"]
["He's trying to amuse himself, that's all.\"", "And didst thou not say,\" continued Anita, without heeding his remarks, regarding him out of the corners of her eyes while lighting her cigarette, \"that she is not quite so tall as the other one, but equally beautiful in her way; that she is pink and white at one and the same moment, just like a half-blown rose, and soft and satiny as the down on a swan's neck?"]
["responded Concho with warmth.", "She is worth a journey to the _Posada_ to see, but then, what is that--what are a few wisps of flowers?", "\"Wisps?"]
["When did the Se\u00f1or ever lavish so many flowers upon one woman before?"]
["That is, if she is clever,\" she added.", "But have we not all heard how clever and beautiful the _Americana_ Se\u00f1oritas are?"]
["He felt as though he had only just begun to live, and he spun a golden web of fancies out of the reality of things which, for one so deeply versed in the game of life, was a marvel of beauty, fair as a poet's dream, yet more substantial.", "And why not?", "Had not his life been one replete with adventure and romance from the cradle?"]
["It was for her, of course.", "A place in which to enshrine and worship her during the years to come; for what else could it be?"]
["\"_Caramba!_\" he cried, quite forgetting his English.", "\"What has happened?", "Is it serious?"]
["They told me you were ill--that you couldn't appear to-day!", "\"Ill?"]
["It was like being thrown suddenly into a river on a cold morning.", "Besides, was she not in a measure justified in wishing to even up their scores?"]
["She laughed to herself at the thought which invariably aroused within her a feeling akin to triumph.", "Why had she not thought of it before?"]
["Any faults which the atmosphere of the stage might have concealed would immediately become apparent in the light of natural surroundings and her performance sink to the level of the commonplace.", "Her dancing could only be amateurish at its best, for where could she possibly have learned to dance?", "What instruction could she, living in this out-of-the-way corner of the world, have received in the art?"]
["And after all was said, what did the achievements of the great dancers really amount to?"]
["As a matter of fact, much of it would not have been called dancing at all by many people, so different has the modern conception of the art become since the days of the ancients.", "But where had she received her instruction?"]
["Among the many guests that had been invited to attend the closing ceremonies was one Signor Tosti, a ballet-master, who at the time was visiting the Capitol with an Italian opera company.", "A friend whose daughter took part in the exercises had persuaded him, much against his will, to attend; for what possible interest could a veteran of the ballet take in such amateurish exhibitions?"]
["She was suffocated--she could have bitten her tongue off!", "Have you no consideration for others' feelings--for what they might want?"]
["Again there was silence between them.", "Can you imagine what it would be like if you were never to see the sun again?", "What could be more absurd than to allow such a trifle as convention to come between you and me?"]
["Bessie wore the despairing look of one who clings to a last vain hope.", "How had it happened?", "Why had everything gone contrary to her expectations?", "Why was Mr. Yankton dragging her at the wheels of his chariot instead of she him?"]
["If any one had suggested such a possibility to her six months previously, she would have laughed at the mere thought.", "How could she relinquish the life she knew for his?"]
["And yet, what woman in her right mind would hesitate to follow the man of her choice to the sunlit valleys of our dreams?"]
["She secretly prayed that she might be spared the torture which Blanch was suffering and the despair which must inevitably overtake her should she fail to win back the man she had let slip from her; for what, after all, could life be to one without the true comradeship of love?"]
["Her intuition told her this in the face of all the world might say to the contrary.", "As she looked back over the years and thought of her friends, she realized that she like them had submerged her life in the superficial pleasures of the world; but had they filled her cup of happiness?"]
["It is not what the world makes of you, but what you make of yourself that counts, the beauteous, seductive night kept whispering to her.", "Why, then, if this be true, should the world about her appear so remote?"]
["That he had received his just deserts for his betrayal of a woman, did not enter his thoughts.", "Had he not atoned for that misdeed through years of suffering?", "Had ever mortal been humiliated as he had been?"]
["A grim smile lit up his countenance as he pondered upon what he knew.", "And yet, he reflected, who could tell?"]
["But he had no thought of employing such a method now even if he were able to.", "Striking the Captain would be like sinking the blade in Chiquita's heart; for did he not hate the Captain, because she loved him, almost as much as he hated her?"]
["Greatly to the Colonel's astonishment and disgust, his daughter seemed strangely lacking in this particular moral quality.", "How had her insight become so obtuse?"]
["He and his wife had not regarded love the chief essential to marriage, so why should his daughter?"]
["Only the Captain seemed capable of keeping his head above water; for him the future held no terrors.", "The more complicated matters became, the more serene he grew; for had he not vowed that he would see things through to the end?"]
["Ever since Dick's declaration of love, Bessie had fought and struggled against the tide of events which was overwhelming her by making herself as disagreeable as possible in his eyes.", "But what could she do to thwart the machinations of a man who laughed at her moods, who encouraged her with each fresh outburst?"]
["The reason for her coming might not be Don Felipe at all, but Captain Forest, the grand Se\u00f1or.", "Who could say?"]
["She had miscalculated.", "She thought she was stronger than Captain Forest, but could she have cared for him had he been a weaker man?"]
["She, like Chiquita, was fighting for her life, her very existence so to speak; but of course he did not divine the full significance of the struggle--what it meant to them both; no man could.", "Does the charm of this land still continue to hold you, Jack?"]
["Don't you think you have had about enough of it?"]
["\"You have had a royal vacation and I'm glad you have enjoyed yourself so thoroughly, but, honestly, don't you think it's about time you were returning to your work again, to the world to which you belong, of which you are a part and from which, in spite of all effort and argument, you cannot possibly separate yourself?"]
["He took another sip of tea.", "\"Jack,\" she said at length, raising her eyes from her hands in her lap where she toyed with her fan, \"supposing a position were offered you, one quite worth your while, would you return?", "Not immediately, but later on, when you have grown a little tired of playing at the game of life?"]
["Again he smiled.", "What was she driving at?"]
["\"I'm afraid it will be longer than that, Blanch,\" he answered.", "\"Besides, what position could possibly be open to me?"]
["But, if you cared enough, there might be another chance!", "What do you mean?"]
["I can't see you wreck your life in this way!", "Can't you see the folly you are committing?"]
["The more I see of it, the more I'm convinced that I'm right.", "What's the use of mincing words, fencing about the truth any longer?"]
["\"Don't wreck your life and happiness before it is too late.", "You must tire of her as inevitably as you will tire of this life, and what then?", "Can't you see that, when you have exhausted the glamour, and the fascination of things is gone, she would no longer be a companion to you?"]
["What can she know of the world which you and I know, to which you belong?"]
["She is still a savage in spite of it, the product of savage ancestry living close to the soil.", "The simplicity and glamour and freedom of this life casts a spell over one and attracts one of your adventurous nature, sated with the pleasures and luxuries of our world, but will the spell last?"]
["she cried in a fresh outburst, \"we were made for one another!", "How can she, an Indian, the product of savagery, understand you who are of a different race, the product of civilization?"]
["I should have consented to share the life you proposed, but I did not believe you were in earnest; I did not think it would last.", "Besides, how could you have expected me to understand?"]
["I thought, of course, you would come back to me again, Jack; I waited for that.", "Can't you understand?"]
["It was undignified, cowardly.", "It disgusted him and he hated himself for it, but what could he do?"]
["I want you to forget everything, all but the days before it happened, when you loved me--when you swore that your love was as constant as the stars!", "Have you forgotten your oath?"]
["\"I am the same as then; I only did not understand you.", "How could I have guessed that which lay buried within you, those latent ideals and conceptions of life which you yourself were ignorant of?"]
["But when he thought of Chiquita, he heard the murmur of forests and waters and saw the broad expanse of the plains and the wild crags and peaks that rear their heads heavenward, above which the eagles soar.", "Poets have sung of the raptures of first love, but was Blanch really his first love?"]
["Sentiment and old memories surged up within him and urged him to keep her.", "What, after all, did it matter where or how they lived?"]
["She's as beautiful and as brilliant as the other woman; one of your own race and, after all, will wear as well.", "Besides, you know her and you don't know the other woman, and if disappointed in the latter--what then?"]
["He, too, stood in the prime of manhood.", "Was this to be his end, mocked and laughed at by fate--the price he must pay for daring to lift his eyes from the dust to the stars to fulfill the dream of the ages?"]
["It was the sound of those wings and the fragrance of the roses that upheld Captain Forest's resolution; especially the fragrance of the roses.", "Whence it came or how it originated, who could say?"]
["She had failed!", "Was this, then, the end, the reward for righteous ambition, conscientious endeavor?"]
["And now, when ambition's goal was attained, that rare cup of earthly joys of which few men drink, had been rudely dashed from her lips.", "So this was the reward that had been reserved for her who had been endowed with wealth and position, and who was the fairest and best this civilization could produce?"]
["Life--what did it mean, what did it hold for her now?"]
["They did not do their best.", "But why had this come to her who had been a willing instrument, who had lent herself to the dictates of this world and who, of all others, was the most fit to grace it?"]
["she cried aloud, springing to her feet in a fresh paroxysm and frenzy, flinging her clenched hands aloft, her features livid with rage.", "But what did her mingled transports of grief and pain and anger avail her?"]
["So close was the bond of sympathy and mutual understanding between them, that she instinctively half divined his thoughts and it gave her courage.", "Will I do, Padre _mio_?"]
["\"Chiquita _mia_--there's one thing lacking,\" he said at length, the far-away, dreamy look fading from his eyes.", "Something lacking?"]
["[Illustration: \"Instinctively he raised the casket with both hands.\"]", "Who was Padre Antonio?"]
["Without a word, he deposited it upon the table in the center of the room and, raising the lid, displayed its contents to the dazzled eyes of his ward.", "Never had she beheld such wonderful jewels--what did it mean?"]
["A dizziness seized him, causing him to lean heavily upon her for support.", "Padre _mio_--what is it?"]
["Those golden _pesos_ would not have purchased a single strand in her bracelet, while as to the necklace, its value would have purchased the entire _Posada_ and many broad acres besides.", "Don Felipe and the Americans had seen such jewels before in the world of fashion, but how came Chiquita by them?", "Who was she?"]
["\"If Captain Forest proposes to her to-night, she'll never lift her eyes to the world again,\" he whispered to Blanch beside whom he sat.", "What do you propose doing?"]
["he replied.", "\"Do you think she would show you such consideration?"]
["\"We have heard so much about your dancing, Se\u00f1orita,\" she began, interrupting the conversation.", "Won't you favor us with a dance to-night?", "A dance?"]
["\"Do dance, Se\u00f1orita; just to please me, if for nothing else,\" persisted Blanch.", "To please you?"]
["A peculiar light came into her eyes and she smiled as though pleased by the request.", "I hope I'm not asking too much?"]
["Again Chiquita smiled.", "Do you know,\" she answered with warmth, \"there's only one thing in this world I wouldn't do for you?"]
["she repeated with emphasis.", "Yes, she would dance as she had never danced before; for would not the most critical eye in the world be watching her?"]
["\"Jack--\" she murmured.", "Chiquita _mia_,\" he said at length, gazing down into her upturned face where the dusk and the moon-fire met and blended in a radiance of unearthly beauty, \"is it not wonderful that, all unwittingly and unconscious of each other's existence, we have been brought together from the ends of the earth?"]
["I apologize most humbly for intruding on your privacy,\" answered Don Felipe, meeting the Captain's gaze unflinchingly, \"but as one who wishes you well, I could not stand quietly by and see a man like you cunningly tricked by this woman.", "What do you mean?"]
["What can he mean, Chiquita asked herself.", "She had expected an attack on the Captain and was prepared for it, but this--what was it?"]
["And this information?"]
["The Se\u00f1orita Chiquita is--the mother of a child.", "The mother of a child?"]
["You shall have the proof you desire--the living proof, Captain Forest,\" he added with emphasis.", "Proof?"]
["Are you bereft of your senses, Don Felipe Ramirez?"]
["If you will return to the _patio_--\" he continued, turning to the Captain.", "Why not here?"]
["Then she suddenly seemed to recover her composure.", "That?"]
["Then it was that the latter grasped the full significance and gravity of the situation.", "What could have been more compromising and humiliating for her?"]
["she exclaimed, stooping and kissing the child, without realizing that her words and action only compromised her the more.", "Is this the beautiful garden you told me of, Mother--which you said you would one day take me to see?"]
["Instinctively the others began to draw near the little group.", "What brings you here, Juana?"]
["answered Chiquita.", "Do you wish for further proof?"]
["\"It is, Se\u00f1or,\" she answered in confusion.", "And has not the Se\u00f1orita visited the child each month and provided for its wants ever since the day it was given into your charge?"]
["And has not the child,\" continued Don Felipe, \"always called her mother ever since it has been able to speak, and have you not always thought her to be its mother?"]
["They are both dead.", "Dead?"]
["Joaquin and Manuelita dead?"]
["Nothing she could say or do could alter the opinion of the world toward her.", "She might continue to deny the charge, protest her innocence, accuse others, but to what avail?"]
["Had not the child recognized her, called her mother before the world?"]
["It was not so much the question of guilt or innocence that affected her now, but the shame of it all.", "What must the Americans think of her?"]
["entreated Padre Antonio, stepping before her.", "Can't you see your silence is condemning you?"]
["\"Be not afraid, my little one, they cannot harm you,\" she answered, drawing the child closer to her and laying one hand on its shoulder.", "Chiquita,\" demanded Padre Antonio at length, \"has this child the right to call you mother?"]
["She knew now that Jack either must return to her, or he would never marry.", "His sensitive, overwrought mind frenzied and made desperate by despair might even drive him to kill himself in the end, but what did it really matter so long as no other woman possessed him?"]
["Although humble in the sight of God, experience had taught him that the only way to command the respect of men was to hold one's head high while among them.", "What must he think of her now, to be requited thus after all he had done for her?"]
["She knew that a continuance of her residence in Santa F\u00e9 was no longer possible.", "Strange that it should have ended thus, and what was before her now?"]
["But what would life be to her under any conditions without Padre Antonio's respect and the Captain's love?"]
["It was with Godspeed, not the maledictions of one's neighbors, that she had hoped to leave the place which had sheltered her so long.", "And Padre Antonio--how could she part from him thus?"]
["He was thoroughly tired, and with a sigh he threw himself into his large leathern chair to rest until Chiquita returned.", "What was the mystery in connection with the child?"]
["Like a flash all became clear to him, and he smiled and nodded as the truth dawned upon him, and he wondered greatly at Chiquita's discretion.", "Yet why should he be astonished?", "Was it not like her?"]
["What did it mean, did he know anything?"]
["she cried, starting backward and gazing full in his face.", "You--you believe in me?", "How could you have imagined anything else, my child?"]
["Padre Antonio started at the mention of the latter's name.", "Pepita Delaguerra?"]
["But as I was about to say: Six months after the marriage, Don Felipe deserted Pepita, then the child was born, and knowing that he would unhesitatingly make way with it should he learn of its existence, Joaquin and I took it to Onava, where we knew it would be hid effectually from the world.", "But why did you not tell me this in the beginning, my child?"]
["I felt impelled to keep you in ignorance of the facts, for I knew that Don Felipe would stop at nothing.", "What would your life have been to him, had you come between him and his position?"]
["she replied.", "\"Whoever would have imagined that, unconscious of the true facts, he would have succeeded in turning my own weapons against me?"]
["Think of what you were and how you came to me, and what your life has been since then!", "Have you endured all for naught?"]
["How strange that they should be there in that out-of-the-way place!", "Who could have foreseen this tragedy, this end to their lives?"]
["The strange nemesis that had pursued them step by step had been permitted to wreck their lives completely.", "And for what end--what purpose?", "Was there no justice, no recompense for them?"]
["She rebelled at the apparent injustice which she felt had been done her.", "Why had she, the most fit, been chosen?", "What had she really done to merit such an end?"]
["It filled her with such exquisite joy to feel anew the power she exercised over him and the unfathomable depth of his love which each fresh thrust at his heart revealed to her.", "I came here,\" she slowly resumed, \"to ask what you think of Chiquita?"]
["he burst forth savagely, aroused almost to a pitch of desperation by her irritating manner.", "\"Do you take me for as big a fool as Don Felipe, or--\" your father?"]
["It was a devilishly clever stroke on Don Felipe's part, I'll admit, but he has deceived himself as thoroughly as the rest of the world.\"", "What proof have you?"]
["Dick chuckled softly in reply.", "What are you laughing at?"]
["she commanded authoritatively.", "Will you never become serious?"]
["What do you mean?"]
["\"Aloud, please,\" he said.", "Why aloud?"]
["Bessie!", "\"Why do you hesitate?"]
["He did not know how intense was the struggle going on within her, nor realize what it meant to her to give up the life she had known always.", "And what if I told you,\" she said at length, her eyes still downcast, \"that I care more for you than anything else in this world, Dick?"]
["What would you say then?"]
["And then he laughed long and loud, laughed as he had never laughed before.", "What are you laughing at?"]
["Her face radiantly beautiful, her jewels flashing against the pale white setting of her dress and her tawny skin, she resembled more the lovely ghost of some long-departed Spanish woman that had returned to earth to revisit familiar haunts, than one still among the living.", "What was he doing now?"]
["For some time he stood silent and motionless as if uncertain what to do, then he began to advance slowly in her direction.", "What did he want?", "Why had he come at this hour?"]
["Sweetheart!", "\"What do we care for the world?"]
["interrupted the Captain, quietly releasing Chiquita from his arms and confronting him.", "Once more--will you go?"]
["answered the Captain, his voice choking with emotion.", "Yet each felt as they gazed on her upturned face, whose expression was rather that of sleep than of death, that she was better off thus; for what did life hold for her?"]
["The community was shaken to its center.", "What would happen next?"]
["That his end was a just punishment for his misdeeds, but then, had it not been for the woman who had wrecked his life, how different his end might have been!", "Juan Ramon would be missed for a day at the gaming tables, but the beautiful American Se\u00f1orita--why should she have paid the price of blood?"]
["And yet it seems to me you have overlooked something--the most important thing of all.", "What?"]
["\"How are you going to get the horses there without attracting attention?"]
["\"_Si, Capitan._ I took them there last night,\" said Jos\u00e9.", "Last night?"]
["I'm glad I forgot them though,\" he added, holding up the moccasins and admiring them.", "How did you come to think of them?"]
["He smiled and rolled a fresh _cigarillo_, lighting it with a pine twig which he took from the fire.", "Tell me why you insisted on our coming this way, Chiquita?"]
["At the mention of the White Cloud, Chiquita sat bolt upright, regarding Jos\u00e9 intently the while--then rose to her feet.", "\"The White Cloud?"]
["she repeated excitedly.", "Then you are a Tewana?"]
["But when he announced that he always saw you in the company of a white man who later should rule over us, they laughed at his prophecies.", "\"'A white man rule over the Tewana?"]
["Beneath them they felt the Earth, ponderous and weighty and crushing in its immensity to the imagination, and whose existence seemed of little moment in comparison to the countless worlds that filled the universe about them.", "Yet, insignificant though it appeared, was it not a link in the great universal scheme of matter, and did it not stand in the same relation to the universe as their individual lives to the human race?"]
["Twenty _pueblos_, in all were destroyed, and may their ruins long continue to stand as monuments of the folly of men!", "But how about your schools and hospitals and asylums and prisons?"]
["You can see how easily we, with our knowledge and theirs, could lead them to the light.\"", "Is there nothing between the picture your people present and the world we know?"]
["What else could there be?"]
["Then, raising the staff which he held in his right hand and pointing directly upward to where the eagle continued to soar in great circles, he cried in a deep sonorous voice that all might hear: \"Behold the sacred bird, God's sign and symbol; the sacred witness to the consecration of His chosen ones!", "For was it not written in the ancient runes that, after the coming of the White Child with a face like the sun, the ancient spirit of Hiawatha, the Red Man's Messiah, would revisit the world of men once more upon the back of an eagle to verify the truth of those words uttered by the White Child?"]
["The message which we have come to deliver unto you, we deliver likewise unto all men and it shall go forth unto the uttermost confines of the earth.\"", "He paused, then raising his voice on high once more, he continued: \"Tewana, do you accept the terms?"]
["\"Tewana,\" he asked again.", "Do you accept the terms?"]
["Those are vanities, which make men puffed up and vainglorious; and they are unsavory in the nostrils of the Big Man.", "And look you, the preacher asks, do they not cost money?", "Are they not time wasters?"]
["Said the preacher: \"Heavy was the punishment of the Big Man on Twm Cwm, persons, because Twm speeched against the capel.", "Was he not put in the coffin in his farm trowsis and jacket?"]
["\"I'd trust Aunt Liz anywhere,\" Olwen declared, loath to have her sister charged with unfaithfulness.", "What do you think, Charlie?"]
["It's as much yours as mine.\"", "Suppose we consult Charlie?"]
["It will be all Jennie's.\"", "\"What guarantee have you of that?"]
["Charlie and Jennie stirred their rage and gave utterance to the harshest sayings they could devise about Lisbeth; \"and I don't care if she's listening outside the door,\" said Charlie; \"and you can tell her it's me speaking,\" said Jennie.", "Why aren't you wearing my presents?"]
["\"That's it,\" Jennie shouted.", "\"Don't you forget to throw cold water, will you?"]
["I don't want to.", "See?"]
["I'll be quite happy if you drop in occasionally.", "Are you not my sister?"]
["\"By then you will have bought it over and over again,\" said Charlie.", "Doesn't give Jennie and me much chance of saving, does it?"]
["\"I thought you had settled all that,\" Olwen faltered.", "\"Did you?"]
["He's worried about money for the new vestry.", "Why didn't you tell me about the new vestry?"]
["For three years Olwen endured her sister's taunts and the storms of her daughter and her son-in-law; and then Jennie said: \"I'm going to have a baby.\"", "If she was glad and feared to hear this, how much greater was her joy and how much heavier was her anxiety as Jennie's space grew narrower?"]
["Disturbed by the noise of the machine, Lisbeth wailed: \"You let me starve but won't let me sleep.", "Why doesn't any one help me?"]
["Olwen muttered the burden of her care: \"'The wife would pull through if she had plenty of attention.", "How could she with her about?"]
["\"For shame to keep from me now,\" said Lisbeth in a voice that was higher than the continued muttering of Olwen.", "\"Have you no regard for the living?"]
["Ben stood in the pulpit, and spoke to the people of Capel Dissenters.", "How many of you have been to his church?"]
["Funny is the Parson in the white frock.", "Ach y fy, why for he doesn't have a coat preacher like Respecteds?"]
["From where does his Church come from?"]
["Iss-iss, earnest affair is this.", "Who gives him his food?"]
["Who pays for Vicarage?"]
["Who feeds his pony?"]
["His cows?"]
["Who built his church?"]
["Abel was at the going in of the close.", "Well-well, Lissi Workhouse,\" he said, \"what's doing then?"]

["Fairish I must be with your sisters.", "\"Why for you cavil like that, father?"]
["Here are some of the sayings that he spoke that night: \"Half an hour ago we were privileged to listen to the voice of a lovely lady--a voice as clear as a diamond ring.", "It inspired us one and all with a hireath for the dear old homeland--for dear Wales, for the land of our fathers and mothers too, for the land that is our heritage not by Act of Parliament but by the Act of God.... \"Who ownss this land to-day?"]

["The men congratulated Ben; and Ben came home and he stood at a mirror, and shaping his body put out his arms.", "How's this for my maiden speech in the house?"]
["\"My Lord, so be it,\" answered Satan.", "How now?"]

["\"But, female, much does the Large One regard His speeches.", "What is the text on the wall?"]
["\"A poor dab you are,\" said Towy.", "\"Many deeds you have?"]
["On a sudden Towy shouted: \"See an old parson do I.", "Is not this the day of rising up?"]
["None gave heed to his cry, for the sound of the bargaining was most high.", "\"Dissenters,\" he bellowed, \"what right have Church heathens to mix with us?"]

["The ardent Italian showered a flood of burning kisses upon her forehead, cheeks and lips, and she quivered like a leaf in his embrace.", "Then he said, with a shade of anxiety in his tone: \"And your brother Esp\u00e9rance, is he disposed to look upon me with approval?"]
["She had never known the details, for both her brother and Giovanni had studiously concealed them from her; indeed, Esp\u00e9rance had carefully avoided all mention of the Viscount's name ever since the day they had become embroiled.", "Was M. Dant\u00e8s aware of the trouble between his son and the youthful Italian?"]
["But how about the coldness existing between us?", "Does it still exist on both sides?"]
["But I could not remain at enmity with the brother of the girl I loved, so when I became cooler I sought him out and endeavored to apologize.\"", "And he accepted your apology?"]
["He evidently thought me a coward and attributed my efforts toward effecting a reconciliation to a desire to escape fighting him.\"", "\"But why did you quarrel in the first place?"]
["It is imperative that I should know it!\"", "Do you doubt me, Zuleika, do you doubt me?"]
["\"Do I doubt you, Giovanni?"]
["The young man gazed at her reproachfully.", "What have I done to turn you thus against me?"]
["\"What have you done?"]
["Strange!", "Who, then, is this man, whose nature so differs from that of every one else?", "Can he so have accustomed his system to poisons, that, as with the King of Pontus, they are ineffectual to help or to harm him?"]
["Indeed, to all appearances, it was a solid block of ebony, and its extreme heaviness, compared with its dimensions, seemed to favor the idea.", "Well?"]
["I thought as much,\" exclaimed he, holding up the vial, which showed, by being nearly empty, that its contents had been used more frequently than those of any of the others.", "How many drops of this is the greatest number your master has ever taken?"]
["The light of joy was shrouded in clouds.", "Arrest--arrest me?"]
["Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s--Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s--oh!", "does she love me yet?"]
["Morrel also is here with his fair bride.\"", "And who is that dark, dignified man in the Turkish costume, around whom the ladies have clustered so inquisitively?"]
["In fact, he is as erudite as an Arab can be, and his library, which is contained in two leathern trunks, accompanied him in all his wanderings prior to his submission.\"", "And what think you really induced him to surrender himself?"]
["He bids fair to be a hard bone of contention between the opposition and the Ministry.\"", "If I mistake not, Lamorici\u00e8re disclaimed all responsibility for accepting the surrender, and placed it on the Governor-General, the young Duke, for whom the Ministry is liable?"]
["I will confess to you, Beauchamp, I attended that soir\u00e9e from curiosity to see whether M. Guizot retained his habitual placidity of manner amid the clouds every day thickening around him.\"", "And what was the result?"]
["Ah, Beauchamp, I envy not the Premier!\"", "And the guests?"]
["The lovely Countess Leven--\" \"Even she was absent.", "And the Countess of Dino?"]
["It is certain, however, that the great man devotes to the enchantress every moment he can steal from the State, though to look at him one would hardly suppose him a lover, in any meaning of the term.", "But who knows?", "To read his writings can one imagine a purer man?"]
["Who is that dark, splendid woman to whom young Joliette seems so devoted?"]
["She has recently left the boards, to the irreparable loss of the opera, having come into possession of an immense inheritance--some millions, it is said, left by her father, who was once a banker of Paris.", "Has Lucien been here?"]
["He--why he said nothing at all, but immediately retired at the head of the opposition from the Chamber.", "To consult?"]
["At length, in utter consternation and dismay the old President put on his hat, and, pronouncing the s\u00e9ance ended, rushed from his chair amid a hurricane of uproarious shouts.\"", "And Odillon Barrot?"]
["was the bland rejoinder; \"and has a manifesto of this decision been issued to the people?\"", "And the Ministry?"]
["Only the Municipal Guard and the troops of the Line can be relied on in the civil conflict, which is sure to come to-morrow.\"", "And the Ministers, what do they?"]
["We shall see, we shall see!\"", "And the Marshal Duke of Islay--where is he?"]
["By heavens, Armand, I think the hour has arrived!", "Whence do you come?"]
["said Louis Blanc, smiling bitterly.", "Did you observe how they shuffled to-night at M. Barrot's, and finally resolved to abandon the banquet, but, as a sop to the people, pledged themselves to impeach the Ministry?"]
["\"The National Guard is secured already,\" said Louis Blanc.", "\"Are they not of the people?"]
["Of the remaining forty thousand, nearly all are well disposed or neutral in feeling.", "Have I studied the National Guard for twenty years in vain, and have all the measures of the Communists to secure them, when the crisis came on, proved utterly ineffectual?"]
["As Louis Blanc ceased speaking, M. Flocon entered the salon, and, as if by some preconcerted arrangement, at once sought his political friends.", "What of the night, watchman?"]
["They have been man and wife for some time, it is said, and any one would take them for lovers at this moment.", "Have they children?"]
["That's enough for me to know of him!\"", "But who really are M. Dant\u00e8s and his wife?"]
["Who really are any of us?"]
["Who really is any one in Paris,\" continued Marrast, \"the blood-royal always and alone excepted?"]
["What need have we to know more?"]
["While this conversation was proceeding, Dant\u00e8s and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s had joined each other, and their hands were quietly clasped.", "Is all well, Edmond?"]
["\"All is well, love,\" replied the husband.", "You will pardon my protracted absence, when I tell you it has been unavoidable--will you not, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s?", "\"Will I not?"]
["But I have been so anxious for your safety, knowing the perilous business in which you are engaged; and the night is so tempestuous.\"", "But you will go home with me now, Edmond, will you not?"]
["he added, smiling.", "And shall we go now, Edmond?"]
["The honors of prophecy are easily won,\" continued the speaker, with a significant smile that lighted up his features, pale with enthusiasm and exhaustion, \"when the problem of seventeen years approaches solution with mathematical certainty!\"", "Are our plans all complete?"]
["The Bourbons will then be in full flight, and France will be free!", "And now, Messieurs, will you permit me to suggest the propriety of our separation?"]
["As for M. Dant\u00e8s, he threw himself carelessly in the way of the Ministerial Secretary to whom he had alluded, who was no other than our friend Lucien Debray, and saluted him with most marked and winning courtesy.", "Will the Ministerial Secretary suffer me to compliment him upon his indefatigable industry and exertions to-night to fortify order in Paris and sustain the administration?"]
["All night infantry have been pouring into Paris, and, obedient to midnight orders, every railway will disgorge, at dawn, additional troops!\"", "Are you a magician?"]
["Shall I reveal to you the Ministerial tactics for the morrow's apprehended insurrection?"]
["It is this: Occupy the Tuileries, the H\u00f4tel de Ville, the Halles, the Louvre and other prominent points with a heavy reserve of infantry and artillery, and sweep the boulevards, and the Rues St. Honor\u00e9, de Rivoli, St. Martin, St. Denis, Montmartre and Richelieu with cavalry.", "A simple plan, is it not?"]
["Here and there, however, through the gray light of the winter dawn, could be caught the semblance of a figure closely muffled, whether for concealment, disguise, or protection from the biting blast was doubtful, stealing along; these figures often met and exchanged ominous signs of recognition.", "Is the procession still to take place?"]
["Dupont, Lamartine and the sixteen others who are faithful are resolute.", "And the rendezvous?"]
["And the hour?"]
["Chiefly, these were artisans, lads, blouses and workmen.", "Whither so early this disagreeable morning?"]
["We were all roused at daybreak in the Quartier St. Honor\u00e9 by the rappel, and so I happen to be awake.", "And are the National Guard turning out in good numbers?"]
["At nine o'clock troops were in motion all over Paris, and the roll of the drum was heard in every street.", "Is there to be a banquet?"]
["That impeachment had already taken place!", "What news?"]
["There has been fighting in the Faubourg St. Marceau; half a dozen Municipal Guards have been carried wounded to the hospital of Val-de-Grace and a captain was killed.", "And is it true that the Guard has been disarmed on the Rues Geoffroi and Langevin, and a gunmaker's shop near the Porte St. Martin broken into and rifled?"]
["said Ledru Rollin.", "\"But where is M. Dant\u00e8s?"]
["\"Three impeachments of the Ministry have been proposed,\" said Lamartine.", "By whom--by whom?"]
["By whom presented?"]
["And what said Guizot?"]
["All the Ministers followed him.\"", "What was discussed?"]
["Barrot then ascended the tribune and deposited a general proposition to impeach the Ministry.\"", "And what was done with it?"]
["\"It is all as it should be,\" said M. Dant\u00e8s, calmly.", "And the peers--what of them?"]
["Is it true,\" asked Flocon, \"that the rappel has been beaten to-day?"]
["They are with us--they are of the people--they shout, 'Vive la R\u00e9forme!'\"", "\"But the Municipal Guard and the Line?"]
["\"It has been rather warm to-day in some parts of Paris,\" said Louis Blanc, smiling.", "\"Was there ever a grander spectacle than that in the Place de la Concorde at noon?"]
["A guard-house was also consumed.\"", "Have you heard Bugeaud's remark at noon, when looking upon the Place de la Concorde?"]
["The two rivals were duly and simultaneously honored it seems.\"", "Thus much for to-day,\" said Marrast; \"what of to-night?"]
["M. Dant\u00e8s and Lamartine left the office in company.", "What say you, Edmond,\" asked Lamartine, \"will your wife spare you long enough from her pillow to make with me a brief tour of the town?"]
["The winter wind swept sharply and cuttingly along the deserted streets, and rain, which froze as it fell, at intervals dashed down.", "Is that a cannon?"]
["Its colonel, M. Bagni\u00e8res, declared to the Duke of Nemours that he could not answer for his men.", "Who are these men?"]
["replied the officer of the National Guard.", "And who are you?"]
["was the hearty response.", "What of the National Guard?"]
["What of the blouses and the barricades?"]
["Who were repulsed?"]
["Three men were killed at the Batignolles, and their bodies were accompanied by an immense throng to the Morgue.\"", "Have you heard that the 5th Regiment, as in 1830, has joined the people, and that, on their way to the Pr\u00e9fecture of Police to liberate some of the people who had been arrested, they stopped at the office of 'La R\u00e9forme,' and were eloquently addressed by our friend, Louis Blanc?", "What did he say to them?"]
["The King in dismay convened the Ministry.", "Can the Ministry maintain itself?"]
["\"That question brings its own answer to your Majesty,\" replied Guizot.", "If you doubt the stability of your Ministry, who can trust them?"]
["What have we to hope for from the change?\"", "What are we to do?"]
["As for him, the same calm smile was on his lip, the same mild light in his eye and the same unchanging resolution upon his countenance.", "Who attended the Chamber of Deputies to-day?"]
["Did you, Lamartine?"]
["For twenty-four hours Paris had been in insurrection.", "Why was this?"]
["And what said Guizot?"]
["The King had called M. le Comte Mole to form a new cabinet.\"", "And then the left cheered?"]
["\"Most emphatically,\" was the reply.", "And what said Guizot then?"]
["exclaimed M. Dant\u00e8s, with enthusiasm.", "And what next?"]
["The demand was so loudly reprobated that M. Barrot immediately said he made the proposal in entire submission to the majority.", "And what said Dupin?"]
["He demanded the adjournment of the impeachment and of all business.\"", "And what did Barrot reply to that?"]
["So long as his cabinet was on those benches, the Chamber need not suspend its labors.\"", "What was the vote on the question to postpone consideration of the impeachment?"]
["At that moment one of the reporters of \"Le National\" hastily entered and handed Marrast a note.", "Whence do you come, Monsieur?"]
["\"This spot will be noted in the future history of France,\" said Louis Blanc.", "\"Do you know the exact facts of the case, M. Albert?"]
["It is better to fight than starve, they think.\"", "But do you observe how few of them are armed?"]
["cried the journalist, in astonishment.", "And whither--and why?"]
["exclaimed the young noble.", "And why?", "Why?"]
["\"One moment!", "Why do you leave in this way?"]
["\"And do you not know--you, a journalist--that for three leagues around, in every direction, every railway radiating from Paris has been torn up?"]
["\"I did hear of this, indeed,\" said Beauchamp.", "And whom think you, among crowds of others, I encountered there?"]
["Well, the banker is dead and she is immensely rich, and I suppose Lucien's spouse into the bargain.\"", "And where go they?"]
["reached the ear.", "Does your Majesty hear that?"]
["\"I do, my son,\" was the trembling reply.", "Do you advise abdication?", "Is there any other course left?"]
["\"Oh!", "are you my son--are you a son of Orl\u00e9ans, and can you talk thus of degradation?", "Are you a soldier and do you fear?"]
["You are surrounded by sixty thousand men of the National Guard, and one hundred thousand of the people of Paris!", "What is demanded?"]
["The gate was immediately opened, and Lieutenant Roche, accompanied by M. Leseur, chef de bataillon, bearing a flag of truce, followed the commandant to the Pavillon de l'Horloge, where stood the Duke of Nemours, pale with excitement, surrounded by generals.", "Messieurs, what do the people demand?"]
["The evacuation, this instant, of this palace, and its delivery to the National Guard!", "And if we do not comply?"]
["\"By the law of 1842, the Duke of Nemours is Regent.", "How can the King abrogate that law?"]
["A provisional government we must first have!\"", "What right have you to speak?"]
["The proprietor, alarmed, shouted for help.", "Do you think us robbers?"]
["screamed a third.", "Are there no printed copies left?"]
["They had not rested for fifty-two hours.\"", "Will 'La R\u00e9forme' appear in the morning?"]
["\"In the name of the people, Citizen Dejean, you are dismissed,\" said \u00c9tienne Arago, entering the private cabinet of the Director General.", "And who is to be my successor?"]
["\"In the name of the people, I am sent to displace and to succeed you,\" was the answer.", "But your commission, Monsieur?"]
["Down--down forever with the kings!\"", "And upward to that dark old pile of despotism, as to the temple of Liberty herself, are turned those tens of thousands of swarthy faces, dark with the smoke of battle, yet livid with excitement and exhaustion--and as they realize that within those walls the question of their fate and that of their country is then being settled--that from that night's counsels in that vast and ancient edifice are to flow peace and prosperity, and freedom and plenty, or else all the untold terrors of anarchy, civil war, bloodshed, violence and strife--what wonder that the sitting of the council seemed endless and their own impatience became intolerable--that all imaginable doubts and fears and absurd apprehensions took possession of their inflamed imaginations?--that at one time the rumor should fly, and win credence as it flew, that the Provisional Government were consulting with the friends of Henry V.--or again, that they were considering the question of a Regency--and that under such influences they should roar and yell, and thunder for admission at the gates, and burden the air with their shouts?"]
["At length you are again with me--all my own!", "Am I not always your own, dearest?"]
["was the laughing rejoinder.", "But all is over now, is it not?"]
["The Republic has begun, and, I trust, will prove lasting.\"", "And all the grand objects for which you have been striving with your noble colleagues for years and years are at length accomplished, are they not?"]
["\"You are very scientific in your comparisons,\" replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, slightly blushing, \"and I suppose I must admit, very apt.", "But tell me, love, is all over?"]
["This Revolution, love, is a social Revolution, and during the sixty-four hours the Provisional Government was in session, in the H\u00f4tel de Ville, I became thoroughly convinced that the thousands and tens of thousands who, with sleepless vigilance, watched their proceedings, had learned the deep lesson too well to be further deceived, and that the fruits of the Revolution they had won would not again be snatched from their lips.\"", "And the result of this triumph of the people you believe has advanced the cause of human happiness?"]
["\"All your friends are not as disinterested as you have been, Edmond,\" said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.", "And why think you that, dear?"]
["And that object?"]
["Well, dear?", "Well, dear?"]
["I suffered--I was wronged--I was revenged.", "But was I happy?"]
["Dant\u00e8s drew her form to his as he would have drawn that of a child, and continued: \"I sought happiness in vengeance for terrible wrongs, and to win it I devoted a life and countless wealth.", "What was the result?"]
["To this end, then, did I devote myself, and to this end, for six years, have I been devoted--to make myself happy by making others happy--you among the rest, dear, dear Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s,\" he added, pressing her to his bosom.", "And am I then so disinterested?", "But why should you achieve triumphs for others to enjoy, Edmond?"]
["Yet they are not!\"", "And why did you refuse to head the Government, Edmond?"]
["Perhaps, indeed, I can do far more for the cause of my race as I am than I could by sacrificing myself for office and position; at least, I hope so.\"", "Is the position of your friends then so perilous?"]
["Europe must be free!\"", "And our friends--Lamartine--Louis Blanc?"]
["M. Dant\u00e8s' eyes sparkled with joy and a faint shade of color appeared upon his pale cheeks.", "What is your name, young patriot?"]
["Esp\u00e9rance hastily and excitedly arose from his chair and stood in front of his sister.", "Beware of Giovanni, Esp\u00e9rance--and why?"]
["But papa----\" \"Has been deceived, as have many others, in regard to the true character and standing of this so-called Roman nobleman.", "And is he not a nobleman?"]
["At least, tell me why you are compelled to maintain silence on a matter of so much importance.", "Did you question the Viscount?"]
["And what answer did he return?"]
["then he has some sense of shame left!\"", "Shame?"]
["I left him.", "And you will not see him again?"]
["But Zuleika said nothing.", "Luigi Vampa?"]
["And again she thought of the abduction of the beautiful peasant girl.", "Could that be the fearful secret?"]
["Zuleika shuddered and felt her heart grow heavy as lead, while a sharp, killing pang ran through it.", "Had Esp\u00e9rance been misled by Vampa and the Viscount?"]
["No, no, she could not accept it without further and more convincing proof!", "But how was that proof to be obtained?", "But Vampa?"]
["Vampa, however, was far away in Rome and inaccessible.", "Zuleika made a wild resolve--she would write to the brigand and throw herself upon his generosity; then she decided that the plan was impracticable; her letter would never reach Vampa--it would be seized by the Roman authorities and might cause additional trouble by reviving a smothered scandal--and even should it reach the brigand, would he answer it?"]
["She had heard the story of Albert de Morcerf's adventure in the catacombs of Saint Sebastian, and was aware that the brigand chief had released him from captivity without ransom at her father's simple solicitation.", "Would not Vampa answer her questions if M. Dant\u00e8s could be influenced to write him and ask them?"]
["Louise did not resist, but still maintained an air of coquetry that was displeasing to the ardent young soldier.", "Albert,\" she said, in a low, musical voice, \"do you, indeed, love me as you say?"]
["I would lay down my life for you!", "\"Are you quite sure you love me for myself and not because of the resemblance you say I bear to the woman you once so ardently admired?"]
["Captain Joliette, strong man as he was, could not control his emotion; he buried his face in his hands and groaned aloud.", "Is there then no shadow of a hope?"]
["The young man recoiled in horror at the suggestion that seemed to be conveyed by this permission.", "What do you mean by friend?"]
["Was separated from me forever through the vile machinations of that mysterious and cold-blooded fiend, the Count of Monte-Cristo!", "The Count of Monte-Cristo?"]
["I will amply repay him for introducing the so-called Prince Cavalcanti into my father's house and thus breaking off the match between Albert and myself.", "Albert?"]
["\"If you are Albert de Morcerf, you must despise me after what has taken place this evening,\" she said, bitterly.", "\"Despise you?"]
["As M. Dant\u00e8s read a shadow suddenly fell on the page of his book, and quickly looking up he saw his daughter Zuleika standing beside him; tears were in her eyes and a look of melancholy rested upon her countenance.", "\"Why child,\" said her father, in a startled tone, \"what is the matter with you?"]
["M. Dant\u00e8s knitted his brows.", "Has the Viscount been guilty of any impropriety toward you?"]
["There may, however, be some truth in it.", "\"His quarrel with Esp\u00e9rance?"]
["They are enemies, papa, or seem to be, and that is not all--Esp\u00e9rance accuses Giovanni of having been guilty of some infamous deed.", "You have spoken to Esp\u00e9rance then on the subject?"]
["And what did he say?"]
["But what is still more so is that both Giovanni and Esp\u00e9rance seem bound by some fearful oath not to disclose the dread secret in their possession.", "Bound by an oath?"]
["The strange power that holds sway over them you cannot break, but there is one thing you can do.\"", "What is that, Zuleika?", "Write to Luigi Vampa!", "\"Write to Vampa?"]
["M. Dant\u00e8s gazed at his daughter curiously.", "What makes you think I have such influence over this Roman brigand?"]
["At the period of the abduction, he now remembered, both Esp\u00e9rance and the Viscount were temporarily absent from Rome; then followed their return and the quarrel that had almost resulted in a duel, but had suddenly been patched up without apparent reason.", "Had Esp\u00e9rance and the Viscount been concerned in the abduction?"]
["The Deputy, though he had made a profound and exhaustive study of men and their varied motives, though he was a skilled anatomist of the human heart and a ready reader of the human countenance, acknowledged to himself that this time he was completely baffled.", "Was it fear or guilt that Esp\u00e9rance exhibited?"]
["He is guilty of a foul and revolting crime, a crime that should condemn him to a life of penal servitude!", "But may you not be mistaken, may you not be the victim of some delusion?"]
["The salon into which M. Dant\u00e8s was ushered was large and sumptuously furnished; evidences of wealth and luxury were visible on every side, while everything displayed the utmost taste and elegance.", "To what am I indebted for the honor of this unexpected visit, my dear Count?"]
["Pray proceed.\"", "You remember your conversation with my daughter just before you and she parted, do you not?"]
["I regret that I can neither empower you to do so nor aid you in it!", "What am I to understand by that?"]
["Something he has kept back, and that something you know.", "What is it?"]
["He did.", "Then who administered that oath to Giovanni?"]
["She began at once, while she did something to her hair before the morsel of mirror: \"Why I wanted to know if you had noticed those people was because they are the reason of his being here.\"", "Did he tell you that?"]
["\"But, evidently, it isn't a chance to be missed, and you must go--instantly.", "Can you go to-morrow?"]
["It's their ancestral town, you know.\"", "\"Bentleys?"]
["I said, \"That may be the nefarious purpose of the young lady, but, as I understood Glendenning, it is no part of her mother's design.\"", "What do you mean?"]
["\"What _do_ you mean?"]
["\"We have come at a bad time,\" I suggested.", "Yes, _why_ did they let us in?"]
["Miss Bentley came hospitably to the door with us, and waited there till she thought we could not see her turn and run swiftly up-stairs.", "Why _did_ you stay, my dear?"]
["But what a ghastly life!\"", "\"Yes; and can you wonder that the poor woman doesn't want to give her up, to lose the help and comfort she gets from her?"]
["\"What are you talking about, Basil?"]
["You have made your own terms with us, and we are keeping them to the letter.", "What more can you ask?", "Do you want me to break with Mr. Glendenning?"]
["You may be thinking of it all the time, but it isn't because of anything I say.\"", "Or that you _do_?"]
["But now tell me what you think of it all.", "Which should your feeling be with the most?"]
["Which side was I on when we talked about them last?", "\"Oh, when did we talk about them _last_?"]
["To think that we should have this beautiful place, where we could be so happy and comfortable, if it were not for having this abnormal situation under our nose and eyes all the time!\"", "\"Abnormal?"]
["\"No; only too natural.", "Isn't it perfectly natural for an invalid like that to want to keep her daughter with her; and isn't it perfectly natural for a daughter, with a New England sense of duty, to yield to her wish?"]
["Marriage is marriage; and it puts the husband and wife with each other first; when it doesn't, it's a miserable mockery.\"", "Even when there's a sick mother in the case?"]
["Then I don't see what we're complaining of.", "\"Complaining of?"]
["Her mother has asked more than she had any right to ask, and Miss Bentley has tried to do more than she can perform, and that has made them hate each other.\"", "Should you say _hate_, quite?"]
["We are mere spectators, and as I see it the situation is not only inevitable for Mrs. Bentley, but it has a sort of heroic propriety for Miss Bentley.\"", "And Glendenning?"]
["\"That is very interesting,\" I said.", "\"I wonder if there is anything in it?", "At first blush it looks so logical; but is it?", "Or are you simply getting morbid?", "What is the error?"]
["\"My dear fellow,\" I said, \"I see your point.", "But don't you think you are quite needlessly adding to your affliction by pressing it?", "Suppose you were prevented by poverty, as often happens?", "It would be a hardship as it is now; but in that case would your engagement be any less an error than it is now?"]
["If you own that you still love each other, you are still engaged, no matter how much you release each other.", "Could you think of loving her and marrying some one else?", "Could she love you and marry another?"]
["Something that my wife had hinted in one of our talks about the lovers freakishly presented itself to my mind, and I said, \"There is a way, and a very practical way, to put an end to the anomaly you feel in an engagement which doesn't imply a marriage.\"", "And what is that?"]
["It had not always been so; at first she had an active rancor against him; but this had gradually yielded to his invincible goodness and sweetness.", "Who could hold out against him?"]
["But as time wore on, and she gave no sign of changing, I have wondered whether some change did not come upon them, which affected them towards each other without affecting their constancy.", "\"What,\" I once suggested to my wife, in a very darkling mood--\"what if they should gradually grow apart, and end in rejoicing that they had never been allowed to join their lives?"]
["I did so, for the better part of the evening, but I could not relinquish it altogether.", "Do you think,\" I asked, finally, \"that any sort of character will stand the test of such a prolonged engagement?", "\"Why not?"]
["It's the one thing that makes me respect our fallen nature.", "Fallen?"]
["Well, I think that was very encouraging, my dear fellow.", "Do you?"]
["Edith herself would never have consented to it.\"", "Did you ever ask her?"]
["How could I?"]
["One of these, as I have already mentioned, was the Conwell place; and after we had talked of the landscape awhile, Glendenning said: \"By the way!", "Why don't you buy the Conwell place?"]
["He called out to the man, who shouted back something I could not understand, and ran on.", "What did he say?"]
["Isn't it a frequent complication with asthma?\"", "\"Asthma?", "Her daughter?"]
["Unless,\" I suggested, \"you could add that her mother had just told her she would not oppose her marriage any longer, and it was the joy that brought on the access of the trouble that is killing her.", "Did the doctor say that?"]
["It would be ghastly.", "What are you thinking of, my dear?"]
["Once it lifted in an upward curve, and a gay light came into the corner of her eye; then the mouth drooped again, and the light went out.", "Gaites could bear it no longer; he rose and said, with a respectful bow: \"Won't you take my seat?"]
["He forbore the more easily because, mixed with this pain, was a certain insecurity as to her quality which he was afraid might impart itself to those patrician presences at the table.", "They would be nice, and they would be appreciative,--but would they feel that she was a lady, exactly, when he owned to the somewhat poverty-stricken simplicity of her dress in some details, more especially her thread gloves, which he could not consistently make kid?"]
["said Birkwall.", "\"You won't change your mind?"]
["Gaites nodded confirmation.", "Then it won't be there in time for the poor thing's birthday?"]
["she said, with a bitterness that was a great comfort to Gaites.", "What are you going to do about it?"]
["It's perfectly heart-sickening.", "Why shouldn't they telegraph?"]
["she asked Gaites, submitting the telegram to him.", "That seems to cover the ground,\" he said, not so wholly hiding the misgiving he began to feel but that she demanded, \"It explains everything, doesn't it?"]
["I?"]
["The blue eyes of June Alber made themselves one with the sky and the river again, and all three laughed at him for his folly in leaving the certain delight they embodied for the vague good of a whim fulfilled.", "Was this the change he had come to the mountains for?"]
["'D ought a been here a week ago.\"", "Why isn't it here now, then?"]
["\"Lower Merritt,\" said Gaites, beginning to feel a little uncomfortable.", "Name?"]
["\"Miss Phyllis Desmond,\" Gaites answered, now feeling really silly, but unable to get away without answering.", "That ain't your name?"]
["A locomotive-bell rang, and Gaites started toward the doorway.", "Is that my train?"]
["He was so exactly of the rustic railroad type that he confused Gaites with a doubt as to which functionary, of the many he now knew, this was.", "Go'n' to walk over to the hotel?"]
["he shouted, and the stage drove off.", "What time can I get a train for Lower Merritt this afternoon?"]
["Evidently it was going to pick up the car with Phyllis Desmond's piano in it.", "When does this freight go out?"]
["\"'Bout ten minutes,\" said the station-master.", "Does it stop at Lower Merritt?"]
["Can I go on her?"]
["The conductor looked amused and interested.", "Eva travel in a caboose?"]
["\"'Tain't but a little way to Lowa Merritt,\" the conductor explained, defensively.", "Eva been the'a?"]
["The head waiter was rather vague about their past; but he was distinct enough about their present, and said the young ladies happened all to be at home.", "I don't know,\" he added, \"whether you noticed our lady orchestra when you came in to dinner to-day?"]
["Gaites started as satisfactorily as could be wished.", "Indeed?"]
["Gaites wondered why he felt suddenly angry; why he resented the head waiter's blush as an impertinence and a liberty.", "After all, the fellow was a student and probably a gentleman; and if he chose to help himself through college by taking that menial r\u00f4le during the summer, rather than come upon the charity of his friends or the hard-earned savings of a poor old father, what had any one to say against it?"]
["VII.", "Can you tell me, madam,\" asked Gaites of an obviously approachable tabby next the chimney-corner, \"which of the musicians is Miss Desmond?"]
["This was the moment to come out with the history of his relation to the piano; but he waited.", "And can you tell me whether they happen to have a female freight agent there?"]
["Maze?\"", "\"Mrs. Maze?"]
["She has a cottage, there.\"", "And can you tell me _why_ Mrs. Maze should be telegraphing me about my piano?"]
["Perhaps she was taken with the beautiful name on the piano-case, and couldn't help telegraphing just for the pleasure of writing it.", "Beautiful?"]
["\"We'll both try,\" said the ex-master of ceremonies.", "Where do you think it is?"]
["Mr. Ellett appeared greatly edified.", "Did _you_ notice that?"]
["Now,\" she said, \"tell me all about yourself.", "About myself?"]
["But I know you don't undervalue the good I may do to my poor sheep--they're _not_ an intellectual flock--in trying to lead them in the ways of spiritual modesty and unconsciousness.", "How do we know but they profit more by my preaching than the faculty would?"]
["But you need never tell me that they wouldn't appreciate you more.", "More than old Ransom Hilbrook?"]
["\"Everybody's glad to see _you_, Clarence,\" she broke out, with tender pride.", "\"But why do you say, 'After we got to talking'?"]
["There was a case of good books in the parlor, and I began by talking with him about them.\"", "Well, what did he say about them?"]
["Yes.", "Yes, what?"]
["He lifted his face, sculptured so fine by age, and blinked at Ewbert, who was glad to fancy something appealing in his words and manner.", "You mean as to a life beyond this?"]
["He gave up the quest as he rejoined his wife with a long, unconscious sigh that made her lift her head.", "What is it, Clarence?"]
["He had vainly hoped she had not noticed this, though he had not concealed from her that his talk with Hilbrook had suggested his theme.", "What are you going to do about him?"]
["They were in the midst of a great question, and they sat down on the decaying doorstep to have it out; Hilbrook having gone in for his hat and come out again, with its soft wide brim shading his thin face, frosted with half a week's beard.", "\"But character,\" the minister urged at a certain point,--\"what becomes of character?"]
["He broke a bit of fragrant spray from the flowering currant--which guarded the doorway on his side of the steps; Ewbert sat next the Spanish willow--and softly twisted the stem between his thumb and finger.", "Ever hear how I came to leave Hilbrook,--West Mallow, as it was then?"]
["Ewbert was forced to own that he had heard a story, but he said, mainly in Hilbrook's interest, that he had not paid much attention to it.", "\"Thought there wa'n't much in it?"]
["You have loved twice, you have grieved twice; in battle you hated more than once; in business you must have coveted many times.", "Can't you see it in that light?"]
["cried Ransom Hilbrook, lifting his fallen head and staring at the minister.", "\"Why, man, you don't suppose I _want_ to live hereafter?", "Do you think I'm anxious to have it all over again, or _any_ of it?", "Is that why you've been trying to convince me of immortality?"]
["\"Oh, he said simply that he could understand a younger person feeling differently, and that he did not wish to set himself up as a censor.", "Well?"]
["Mrs. Ewbert heard old Hilbrook begin at once in a high senile key without any form of response to her husband's greeting: \"There was one thing you said to-day that I've been thinkin' over, and I've come down to talk with you about it.\"", "Yes?"]
["\"You didn't go to the Book for the point you made _against_ me.", "But if you go to it now for the point I want you to make _for_ me, what are you going to find?", "Are you going to find the promise of a life any different from the life we have here?"]
["cried the old man.", "\"We are in the keeping of the divine Love here, too, and are we happy?", "Are those who live rightly happy?", "It's because we're not conditioned for happiness here; and how are we going to be conditioned differently there?", "Like what?"]
["He hitched his chair closer to Ewbert's, and laid some tremulous fingers on the minister's sleeve.", "If I've got to live forever, what have I got to live for?"]
["Apparently, our way has brought us to a dead wall; but I believe there's light beyond it, if we can only break through.", "Is it really necessary that we should discover some new principle?"]
["Have you seen a mother with her child?"]
["In fact, we have got rid of three, for without fear and greed men cannot hate.\"", "But how can we exist without them?"]
["Why not?"]
["\"Ah, as we know ourselves here, I grant you,\" said the minister.", "Have you ever read Isaac Taylor's Physical Theory of another Life?"]
["Why should not the immortal soul be simple, too?"]
["_Why_ couldn't you leave him alone!\"", "\"To his apathy?", "To his despair?"]
["He didn't come to make a call; he just wanted to borrow a book,--Physical Theory of another Life.", "How did you find it?"]
["He controlled himself at last, and sank into his chair.", "Where were we?"]
["His eyes met those of Ewbert not only without surprise, but without any apparent emotion.", "Why, Mr. Hilbrook,\" said the minister, \"are you sick?"]
["\"Oh,\" said Ewbert, apologetically, and he did not know quite what to do; he had an aimless wish for his wife, as if she would have known what to do.", "In her absence he decided to shut the door against the hens, who were returning adventurously to the threshold, and then he asked, \"Is there something I can do for you?"]
["The consciousness of unconsciousness?"]
["Something occurred to Ewbert which seemed to him of more immediate usefulness than the psychological question.", "\"Couldn't I get you something to eat, Mr. Hilbrook?"]
["When we speak of Nature, we figure her as one thing, with a fixed purpose and office in the universal economy; but she is an immense number of things, and her functions are inexpressibly varied.", "We call certain phenomena unnatural; but in a natural world how can anything be unnatural, except the supernatural?"]
["You were very glad to have me do it at the time!", "And what use would there have been in your killing yourself, anyway?"]
["the minister cried out.", "What are you saying?"]
["He stopped in the hall, and then, tempted by his despair, he stepped within the open door of the next room and looked vaguely over it, with shame at being there.", "What was it that the girl had missed, and had come back to look for?"]
["They used to go away winters,--teaching, I guess,--but this last year they stayed right through.", "Wake you up last night?"]
["For the moment, in his shame, it seemed to him that the only thing for him was to go back to New York by the first train in the morning.", "But what then would the girl think of him?"]
["That voice which had haunted him so long, was he never to hear it again?", "Was he willing to renounce forever the hope of hearing it?"]
["Is she going soon?\"", "\"Who?", "Juliet?"]
["She was suffering from their anomalous position as much as he, but she had the means of enjoying it while he had not.", "She said to each in turn, \"Won't you take some lemonade?"]
["\"She'd a good deal rather go day after to-morrow, anyway.", "What have you been talking about?"]
["Have you got through with the weather?"]
["Lemonade!", "\"Has Aunt Elmira been giving you lemonade while I was gone?"]
["She struck the refractory sheet of music flat upon the rack with her palm, and then tilted her head over her shoulder towards Langbourne, who had risen with some vague notion of turning the sheets of the song.", "Do you sing?"]
["Her voice was still a silver bell, but it was not gay, and her face was severely unsmiling.", "To see _me_?"]
["She held a little packet, tied with blue ribbon, in her intertwined hands, and she looked urgently at him.", "I shall be very glad,\" Langbourne began, but she interrupted,-- \"Should you mind walking down to the Falls?"]
["I hope Mrs. Simpson is well?"]
["\"I've brought you your letters to her,\" and she handed him the packet she had been holding.", "Have you got hers with you?"]
["\"All right,\" said the young man.", "I suppose you're coming too?"]
["You've got to be ready at two o'clock.\"", "That so?"]
["He believed too late that he had made a mistake, that he had thrown away the supreme chance of his life.", "But was it too late?"]
["Why, of course!", "I mean, was it your idea?"]
["We got to talking it over, and--and we thought we had better.", "Because I had come here without being asked?"]
["He stopped as if withholding himself from what he had nearly said without intending, and resumed: \"It's some comfort to know that you didn't want them back because you doubted me, or my good faith.\"", "Then why did you?"]
["She turned and looked at him, with the eyes which he knew saw his face dimly, but saw his thought clearly.", "What made you think that?"]
["She now turned and looked fully at him, though he was aware of being a mere blur in her near-sighted vision.", "Do you mean to ask it now?"]
["And have you wished to ask it ever since you first saw me?"]
["I'm not sure how you want me to answer you.", "Not sure?"]
["I knew it.\"", "\"No; not disappointed--\" \"Why not?"]
["I mean that your voice and your looks went together again.\"", "As soon as you got away?"]
["I'm not certain that I ever could.", "And if I couldn't?"]
["It counted thirty of them at least before he spoke, after a preliminary noise in his throat.", "There is one thing I should like to ask: If you had cared for me, would you have been offended at my having thought you looked differently?"]
["The Spanish song he had given her was lying open upon it, and she struck some of the chords absently, and then let her fingers rest on the keys.", "Miss Simpson,\" he said, coming stiffly forward, \"I should like to hear you sing that song once more before I--Won't you sing it?"]
["\"Oh, certainly,\" said Langbourne in polite mystification.", "It was all through a misunderstanding that I don't think _I_ was to blame for, to say the least; but I can't explain it without making Barbara appear perfectly--Mr. Langbourne, _will_ you tell whether you are engaged?"]
["I believe I will go.\"", "But you have a right to know--\" \"Would my knowing alter the main facts?"]
["Love ends, sorrow ends, and to our mortal sense everything that is mortal ends, whether that which is spiritual has a perpetual effect beyond these eyes or not.", "But if fame ended, did not infamy end, too?", "If glory, why not shame?", "What was it, I mused, that made an evil deed so much more memorable than a good one?", "Why should a crime have so much longer lodgment in our minds, and be of consequences so much more lasting than the sort of action which is the opposite of a crime, but has no precise name with us?", "Was it because the want of positive quality which left it nameless, characterized its effects with a kind of essential debility?", "Was evil then a greater force than good in the moral world?"]
["I did not hold myself responsible in this will-less revery for the question which asked itself, Whether, then, evil and not good was the lasting principle, and whether that which should remain recognizable to all eternity was not the good effect but the evil effect?"]
["March?\"", "Yes,\" I called back, \"what is wanted?"]
["I knew him now, but I did not know what terms to put my recognition in, and I faltered.", "What do you want with me?"]
["There was an offer of propitiation in this smile, too, and I did not like that, either; but I was touched when I saw a certain hope die out of his eye at the failure of his appeal to me.", "Who told you I was here?"]
["The house he meant was a place I had taken for the summer a little out of town, so that I could run in to business every day, and yet have my mornings and evenings in the country; the fall had been so mild that we were still eking out the summer there.", "How did you know where I was staying?"]
["I was truly sorry for the man; in a way, I did pity him; at the same time I did not wish to be mixed up in his affairs; in washing my hands of them, I preferred that there should be no stain of falsehood left on them.", "Where is my sister-in-law?"]
["I couldn't say from my own knowledge where she was.", "But you haven't heard of her leaving Somerville?"]
["Do you ever meet her husband?"]
["The last time you saw _her_, did she speak of me?"]
["It was a good many years ago.\"", "Was she changed toward me at all?"]
["I do not believe Tedham cared for this, after all, though he made a show of having to collect himself before he went on.", "Then you think my daughter is with her?"]
["I don't know anything about it.\"", "March,\" he urged, \"don't _you_ think I have a right to see my daughter?"]
["said the man.", "\"If you were in my place, wouldn't you want to see her?"]
["And--simply, I can't.\"", "How do you know,\" he entreated, \"that my daughter wouldn't be as glad to see me as I to see her?"]
["I don't know how you came to write it!\"", "Why, of course, Tedham, I felt sorry for you--\" \"Oh, did you, did you?"]
["I called after him.", "Well?"]
["she demanded, instantly.", "Have you seen him?"]
["Then he wanted me to go to Mrs. Hasketh and find out.\"", "You didn't say you would?"]
["\"Well, at any rate, you have had the sense not to mix yourself up in his business.", "Did he pretend that he came straight to you, as soon as he got out?"]
["Basil!", "\"Why do you object to the fact?"]
["He must have suffered.", "\"But does suffering change people?"]
["Certain material accessories of Tedham's have changed.", "But why should that change Tedham?"]
["He would hardly take no for an answer from me, when I said I wouldn't go to the Haskeths for him; and when I fairly shook him off, he wanted me to ask you to go.", "And what did you say?"]
["I don't think it was very nice of you to shift the whole responsibility on me.\"", "\"How did I do that?"]
["His eyes were deep in their sockets, and showed fine shadows in the overhead light, and I must say he looked very interesting.", "\"I am glad to see you, Mr. Tedham,\" she said; and I should have found my astonishment overpowering, I dare say, if I had not felt that I was so completely in the hands of Providence, when she added, \"Won't you come out to dinner with us?"]
["\"Yes,\" she answered, most unexpectedly to me, \"I will try to see her.", "But if I do see her, and she refuses to tell me anything about your daughter, what will you do?"]
["But, of course, there is another point of view.", "My daughter's?"]
["They might as well have let me go in the beginning.", "Don't you think that ten years out of my life is enough for a thing that I never intended to go as far as it did, and a thing that I was led into, partly, for the sake of others?"]
["Is it to go on forever, and am I never to be rid of the consequences of a single act?"]
["The address was Mrs. Hasketh's, in Somerville, and the date was about three months after Tedham's punishment began.", "Is that the last you have heard from her?"]
["Tedham nodded as he took the letter from me.", "But surely you have heard something more about her in all this time?"]
["But suppose your daughter were so situated that it would be--disadvantageous to her to have it known that you were her father?\"", "\"You mean that I have no right to mend my broken-up life--what there is left of it--by spoiling hers?"]
["Above all, I urged something that came to me so forcibly at the moment that I said I had always thought it, and perhaps I really believed that I had.", "\"Why should we try to shield people from fate?", "Isn't that always wrong?"]
["Why shouldn't we have offered him a bed for the night, as we would any other acquaintance?\"", "But if he was sentenced to pay a certain penalty, and has paid it, why, as he said, shouldn't we stop punishing him?"]
["She answered from the effort that I could see she was making, to brace herself already for the work before us: \"Well, we must do this because we can't help doing it, and because, whatever happens, we had no right to refuse.", "You must come with me, Basil!\"", "\"I?"]
["\"Yes, I am almost afraid to think how many,\" she answered.", "Family well?"]
["But that is about all.\"", "I hope Mrs. Hasketh is well?"]
["She wanted to write to him at first, and of course I let her--\" My wife and I could not forbear exchanging a glance of intelligence, which Mrs. Hasketh intercepted.", "I presume he told you?"]
["I'll prepare her for it as well as I can, and he can come if she wishes it.\"", "Do you mean that he can see her _here_?"]
["\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Hasketh, with a sort of strong submission.", "\"At once?"]
["\"It's so graceless, so tasteless!", "Why didn't Tedham die before the expiration of his term and solve all this knotty problem with dignity?", "Why should he have lived on in this shabby way and come out and wished to see his daughter?"]
["Tom says he looks as if he had been in some kind of business, and then failed.\"", "What makes you think that, Tom?"]
["I could not let the matter end so bluntly, and I added, in the same spirit one makes a scrawl at the bottom of a page, \"Of course, it's for you to decide whether you will or not.\"", "What do you mean?"]
["\"Right!", "How are you right?"]
["Tedham shook his head stubbornly.", "\"She has borne her share, already, and I won't inflict my penalty on her innocence--\" \"Innocence?"]
["I would have detained him, but my wife made me a sign not to interfere.", "But surely, Mr. Tedham,\" she pleaded, \"you are going to leave some word for her--or for Mrs. Hasketh to give her?"]
["If I don't appear, then she won't see me, and that will be all there is of it.\"", "Yes, but Mrs. Hasketh will probably tell her that you have asked about her, and will prepare her for your coming, and then if you don't come--\" \"What time is it, March?"]
["I was surprised to find it no later.", "\"I can get over to Somerville before ten, can't I?"]
["\"Well, then, I can tell you that I merely said it so as to convince him that he ought to let his daughter decide whether she would see him or not, and it had nothing whatever to do with the matter.", "Do you think you could find me anything to eat, dear?"]
["\"That is the way it has seemed to me, too, all day,\" said my wife.", "\"You don't suppose he has been out of my mind either?"]
["You don't suppose it's Tedham's daughter?\"", "\"How do I know?"]
["The young girl put aside her veil in turning to my wife, and showed a face which had all the ill-starred beauty of poor Tedham, with something more in it that she never got from that handsome reprobate--conscience, soul--whatever we choose to call a certain effluence of heaven which blesses us with rest and faith whenever we behold it in any human countenance.", "\"Do you think my father will be here again to-night?"]
["\"Why, I don't know about that,\" I returned, and I began to laugh.", "You know Hubbell, our inspector of agencies?", "What has he got to do with it?"]
["\"Monsieur d'Avranche--\" responded the lady softly, pausing.", "\"Did the Bailly make a stir?"]
["\"My little daughter must have better manners,\" responded the lady, looking down at her child reprovingly yet lovingly.", "Or the Bailly must--eh, Madame?"]
["They were neither blue nor grey, but a mingling of both, growing to the most tender, greyish sort of violet.", "What is your name, little lady?"]
["D'Avranche wanted to laugh, but the face of the child was sensitive and serious, and he only smiled.", "Say 'Yes, Philip', won't you?"]
["\"Good-bye, Sir Philip,\" had a different meaning, though the words were the same.", "Sir Philip--eh?"]
["There was no wind, apparently no breath of air, yet the leaves of the trees moved, the weather-vanes turned slightly, the animals in the byres roused themselves, and slumbering folk opening their eyes, turned over in their beds, and dropped into a troubled doze again.", "Presently there came a long moaning sound from the tide, not loud but rather mysterious and distant--a plaint, a threatening, a warning, a prelude?"]
["If he lands safe, and the English troops ain't roused, he'll take the town and hold the island easy enough.\"", "But the pilot, is he certain safe?"]
["Rullecour he can march straight to the town and seize it--if he land safe.", "But will he stand by 's word to we?"]
["He'll be honest to us, man, or he'll be dead inside a week, that's all.", "I'm to be Connetable of St. Heliers, and you're to be harbour-master--eh?"]
["Two thousand; mostly conscripts and devil's beauties from Granville and St. Malo gaols.", "Any signals yet?"]
["At first he was dazed, but at length all that had happened came back to him.", "Where was he now?"]
["Now the door creaked on its hinges, and in a moment he was out on the stone flags of the bakeroom.", "The windows?"]
["His reflections tortured him.", "Why had he not stopped the nightfarer?"]
["She always called him \"Ro,\" because when beginning to talk she could not say Ranulph.", "Ro, won't it never come back?"]
["The daft one whinnied with delight.", "What's o'clock, bread-man?"]
["Dormy Jamais tore at a loaf with his teeth, and crammed a huge crust into his mouth.", "Come, tell me, will you go, Dormy?"]
["He had come to stay a traitor in his crime, and here he found a martyr.", "But was not he himself likewise a traitor?", "Ought not he to have alarmed the town first before he tried to find his father?", "Had Dormy Jamais warned the Governor?"]
["What would the world think of him!", "Well, what was the use of fretting here?"]
["Yes, but suppose the French were driven out, and the baker taken prisoner and should reveal his father's complicity!", "And suppose people asked why he himself did not go at once to the Hospital Barracks in the town and to the Governor, and afterwards to Gorey?"]
["He was only a boy, but he could fight.", "Had not young Philip d'Avranche; the midshipman, been in deadly action many times?"]
["He tilted the bucket and drank.", "He would have liked to ask for bread at the cottage-door, but he said to himself, Why should he eat, for was he not going to die?", "Yet why should he not eat, even if he were going to die?"]
["Dormy Jamais had a poor opinion of a governor who slept.", "He himself was not a governor, yet was he not always awake?"]
["Ranulph Delagarde, sir.", "\"Delagarde--eh?"]
["Then he turned to Ranulph in recognition.", "Ranulph Delagarde, eh?"]
["Her great desire had been to live till the girl was eighteen.", "Then--well, then might she not perhaps leave her to the care of a husband?"]
["......................... \"She has met her destiny,\" say the village gossips, when some man in the dusty procession of life sees a woman's face in the pleasant shadow of a home, and drops out of the ranks to enter at her doorway.", "Was Ranulph to be Guida's destiny?"]
["es-tu gentiment?\"", "You'll have breakfast?"]
["the young man said, glancing through the open doorway again to where the connetable's men were dragging two vile-looking ruffians into the Vier Prison.", "What's happened, monsieur?"]
["What was it, monsieur?"]
["'Feel,' said Louis, placing his hand on his bosom, 'feel whether this is the beating of a heart shaken by fear.'", "Ah, my friend, your heart would have clamped in misery to hear the Queen cry: 'What have I to fear?", "Death?"]
["Detricand nodded with a droll sort of helplessness, and answered: \"In Jersey I never have chance to forget it, Chevalier.\"", "Have you knowledge of the Comte de Tournay, monsieur?"]
["The old Chevalier shook his head sadly.", "Is he dead?"]
["There was a slight pause, and then Detricand answered: \"No, still living.\"", "Where is he?"]
["Might I not write to him?"]
["Assuredly, Chevalier.", "Could you--will you--despatch a letter to him from me, monsieur?"]
["\"It will make my cousin so happy--so happy,\" quavered the little Chevalier.", "Will you take snuff with me, monsieur?"]

["Ranulph turned on his heel.", "Where are you going, Ro?"]
["Something in these rocks, something in the Paternosters--perhaps their distance, perhaps their remoteness from all other rocks--fascinated her.", "As she looked at them, she suddenly felt a chill, a premonition, a half-spiritual, half-material telegraphy of the inanimate to the animate: not from off cold stone to sentient life; but from that atmosphere about the inanimate thing, where the life of man has spent itself and been dissolved, leaving--who can tell what?"]
["She looked from the rocks to the approaching frigate.", "Was it the Narcissus coming--coming to this very island?"]
["\"I shouldn't deserve to be here if I had forgotten,\" she answered meaningly.", "Perhaps you forget the sword of the Turk?"]
["Then he added rhetorically: \"I've seen a man polishing the buckle of his shoe, and he was planning to take a city or manoeuvre a fleet.\"", "Philip?"]
["But girls have dreams, they have memories.", "\"If women hadn't memory,\" she answered, \"they wouldn't have much, would they?"]
["She laughed a little ironically.", "I wonder that we think at all or have anything to think about, except the kitchen and the garden, and baking and scouring and spinning\"--she paused slightly, her voice lowered a little--\"and the sea, and the work that men do round us....

["She sighed, and continued: \"That's as far as I get with thinking.", "What else can one do in this little island?"]

["It's not so.", "How can one see and learn unless one sees and knows the world?"]
["He changed his tactics instantly.", "The world--that was the thing?"]
["\"You can't know things unless you see widely.", "You must see the world.", "This island, what is it?"]
["Yet it had all seemed so good to her in the past; broken only by little bursts of wonder and wish concerning that outside world.", "Do we ever learn how to live?"]
["\"Don't we just go on from one thing to another, picking our way, but never knowing quite what to do, because we don't know what's ahead?"]
["\"For now I know that I have but two things to live for: for my work\"--he pointed to the Narcissus--\"and for you.", "You are frightened of me?"]
["The seed was sown then, the flower springs up to-day, that is all.", "You think I can't know that it is love I feel for you?"]
["When you see a flower in a garden, do you not know at once if you like it or no?", "Don't you know the moment you look on a landscape, on a splendid building, whether it is beautiful to you?"]
["For the first time since he had spoken she smiled, yet her eyes filled with tears too.", "You will let me tell you that I love you, Guida--it is all I ask now: that you will listen to me?"]
["Her face was very young, though the eyes were so wise in their simplicity.", "You will give me my chance--you will listen to me, Guida, and try to understand--and be glad?"]

["It was not that of the Reverend Lorenzo Dow.", "Where had he heard that voice before?"]
["Philip watched Carterette now for a moment, a dozen laughing memories coming back to him; for he had teased her and played with her when she was a child, had even called her his little sweetheart.", "Looking at her he wondered what her fate would be: To marry one of these fishermen or carters?"]
["She frowned in vexation, yet she saw that he was pale and heavy-eyed, and she beckoned him to come to her.", "What's gone wrong, big wood-worm?"]
["She was not satisfied, but she went on talking, intent to find the cause of his abstraction.", "Only to think,\" she said--\"only to think that he wasn't killed at all at the Battle of Jersey, and was a prisoner in France, and comes back here--and we all thought him dead, didn't we?"]
["They nabbed him, and carried him aboard their boats to pilot them out from the Rocque Platte, and over to France.", "Then because they hadn't gobbled us up here, what did the French Gover'ment do?"]
["Carterette took no note, but said to Ranulph: \"Of course he had to pilot the Frenchmen back, or they'd have killed him, and it'd done no good to refuse.", "He was the first man that fought the French on the day of the battle, wasn't he?"]
["She was not very quick of intellect, so she had to feel her way fumblingly.", "She must have time to think, but she said tentatively: \"I suppose it's no secret?"]
["She might be, as she was, variable with other people; with himself she was invincibly straightforward.", "P'raps you don't trust me?"]
["Don't go telling folks I look as if I was in trouble.", "I'm going to launch to-morrow the biggest ship ever sent from a Jersey building yard--that doesn't look like trouble, does it?"]
["As Carterette turned round to him he was twirling a cake on the wooden fork, and trolling: \"Caderoussel he has a coat, All lined with paper brown; And only when it freezes hard He wears it in the town.", "What do you think of Caderoussel?"]
["Man doux d'la vie, you chatter like a monkey!\"", "That poor Maitre Ranulph,\" said Dormy, \"once he was lively as a basket of mice; but now--\" \"Well, now, achocre?"]
["Many pressed forward to shake hands with him.", "Help of heaven, is that you, m'sieu'?"]
["Presently, free of the crowd and entering the Rue d'Egypte, he said to Ranulph: \"I'm going alone; I don't need you.\"", "Where are you going?"]
["All right; better not come out again to-day.", "You're not going to let that Frenchman hurt me?"]
["\"You're going to stop that?"]
["All at once they came face to face with Detricand.", "His brow knitted when he saw that his compatriot had been drinking again, and his eyes had a pained look as he said eagerly: \"Have you heard from the Comte de Tournay, monsieur?"]
["The little chevalier's lips trembled, and taking the young man by the collar of his coat, he stood tiptoed, and kissed him on both cheeks.", "Will you accept something from me?"]
["Ranulph's anxiety deepened.", "\"He might come back, and then if anything happened to him--\" \"He'd try and make things happen to others, eh?"]
["It was not to be borne.", "Why not leave it all behind?", "Why not let his father shift for himself, abide his own fate?"]
["I'm going away, and I wanted to thank you.", "Will you not come in, monsieur?"]
["He readily entered the kitchen, still holding the handkerchief in his hand, but he did not give it to her.", "Where will you sit?"]
["Also I fell in love with the cook.\"", "Why do you tell me these things?"]
["\"Excuse me, monsieur, but why do you always tell unpleasant things about yourself?"]
["A look of disgust came into her face.", "\"Why do you relate this sort of thing to me, monsieur?"]
["She looked at him scarce comprehending, yet feeling a deep compliment somewhere, for this man was a gentleman by birth, and his manner was respectful, and had always been respectful to her.", "Why do you want me to ask you that?"]
["Because I'm going to France to join the war of the Vendee, and--\" \"With the Comte de Tournay?"]
["Detricand's eye flashed, but he answered coolly: \"It wasn't talent that brought me here, but a boy's folly; it's not talent that's kept me from starving here, I'm afraid, but the ingenuity of the desperate.\"", "\"Why stay here?"]
["\"I've certainly been my own enemy, whether the strokes were heavy or light,\" replied Detricand, lifting a shoulder ironically.", "And a friend to Jersey at the same time, eh?"]
["No,\" he answered, \"I've been an enemy to Jersey too, both by act and example; but people here have been kind enough to forget the act, and the example I set is not unique.", "You've never thought that you've outstayed your welcome, eh?"]
["Our grudge is not individual, it is against France, and we'll pay it soon with good interest, monsieur.", "The individual grudge will not be lost sight of in the general, I hope?"]
["Guida and Philip stood looking after him in silence for a minute.", "Suddenly Guida said to herself: \"My handkerchief--why did he take my handkerchief?"]
["Philip turned on her impatiently.", "\"What was that adventurer saying to you, Guida?"]
["To-day Guida should hear a message beyond all others in importance.", "Won't you come into the garden?"]
["He felt he must say something, and in a sympathetic tone he replied: \"Yes, Guida, but after a while we stop trying to follow and see and find, and we walk in the old paths and take things as they are.\"", "Have you stopped?"]
["Have you?"]
["Guida, I want to go on telling you the same story for a long time--even till you or I die.\"", "Do you--ah, then, do you?"]
["Do you really wish that?"]
["\"I like to hear you say it,\" she answered simply, \"and it cannot be wrong, can it?", "Is there any wrong in my listening to you?"]
["I love you, Guida, love you devotedly.", "Do you--tell me if you love me?"]
["Philip drew her to him, and her eyes lifted to his.", "Is that love, Philip?"]
["\"As the Judgment of Life is before us, I believe you love me, Guida--though I don't deserve it,\" he answered with tender seriousness.", "And it is right that you should love me; that we should love each other, Philip?"]
["Too much had come all at once.", "\"Why should I?"]
["She could scarcely speak.", "\"To-morrow--to-morrow, Philip?"]
["My grandfather--\" \"Your grandfather need not know, sweetheart.\"", "How can you say such wicked things, Philip?"]
["Somehow she felt wiser than he at that moment, wiser and stronger, though she scarcely defined the feeling to herself, though she knew that in the end her brain would yield to her heart in this.", "Would it make you so much happier, Philip?"]
["Yes, on my honour--supremely happy.", "You are afraid that otherwise, by some chance, you might lose me?"]
["I should be better able then to tell the poor grandpethe.", "Will you promise me, Philip-dear?"]
["\"My Philip,\" she answered softly.", "Won't you say, 'Philip, my husband'?"]
["He was revelling in the beauty of the girl before him, in her perfect outward self, in her unique personality.", "The more subtle, the deeper part of her, the searching soul never to be content with superficial reasons and the obvious cause, these he did not know--was he ever to know?"]
["He smiled at her, and touched her shining hair.", "\"Evil can't come out of good, can it?"]
["There, look into my eyes that way--just that way.\"", "Are you happy--very, very happy, Philip?"]
["\"Perfectly happy, Guida,\" he answered; and in truth he seemed so, his eyes were so bright, his face so eloquent, his bearing so buoyant.", "And you think we have done quite right, Philip?"]
["We love each other, we are married as surely as others are married.", "Where is the wrong?"]
["\"Oh, it isn't what the clergyman might think that I mean; it's what we ourselves think down, down deep in our hearts.", "If you, Philip--if you say it is all right, I will believe that it is right, for you would never want your wife to have one single wrong thing like a dark spot on her life with you--would you?"]
["There, sweetest interrogation mark in the world, there is the law and the gospel!", "Come, come, let us be gay, let this be the happiest hour we've yet had in all our lives.\"", "How can I be altogether gay, Philip, when we part now, and I shall not see you for two whole long months?", "Mayn't I come to you for just a minute to-morrow morning, before I go?"]
["She had seen more than one ship launched, and a strange shiver of pleasure and of pain had gone through her; for as the water caught the graceful figure of the vessel, and the wind bellied out the sails, it seemed to her as if some ship of her own hopes were going out between the reefs to the open sea.", "What would her ship bring back again to her?", "Or would anything ever come back?"]
["How wonderful that so many millions who had loved had come and gone, and yet of all they felt they had spoken no word that laid bare the exact feeling to her or to any other.", "The barbarians who raised these very stones she sat on, they had loved and hated, and everything they had dared or suffered was recorded--but where?", "And who could know exactly what they felt?"]
["She knew that he cared for her--loved her.", "Where had he been these weeks past?"]
["He asked Carterette many questions.", "He had known the house years before--did the deep stream still run beneath it?", "Was the round hole still in the floor of the back room, from which water used to be drawn in old days?"]
["Did not the noise of the water worry poor M. Detricand then?"]
["He moved swiftly to the window, for the presence was near the door.", "What did it mean?", "Who was it?", "Was there one, or more?", "Was murder intended?", "The silence, the weirdness, stopped his tongue--besides, what was the good of crying out?"]
["Detricand held it down, and there was revealed the haggard, malicious face of Olivier Delagarde.", "So, monsieur the traitor,\" said Detricand--\"so you'd be a murderer too--eh?"]
["After a moment he said: \"What I want to know is, how could a low-flying cormorant like you beget a gull of the cliffs like Maitre Ranulph?\"", "The old man did not answer, but sat blinking with malignant yet fearful eyes at Detricand, who continued: \"What did you come back for?", "Why didn't you stay dead?"]
["You're the choice blackamoor of creation, aren't you?"]
["He had never seen so craven a sight.", "What were you in prison for in Guiana, and what did they do to you there?"]
["Detricand understood now.", "The old man had been tied to a triangle and whipped--how horribly who might know?"]
["There was only the weird sound of the running water through the open trap-door of the floor.", "You hear that water running to the sea?"]
["The old man shivered violently.", "\"You know Manon Moignard the witch?"]
["'Then let the name of Guidabaldine be somewhere among others she will carry, and--and I'll not forget her, de Mauprat, I'll not forget her.'...", "Eh, eh, I wonder--I wonder if he has forgotten the little Guidabaldine there?", "He sent her a golden cup for the christening, but I wonder--I wonder--if he has forgotten her since?"]
["Guida drew near.", "The Narcissus is not leaving to-day?"]
["Not to-day, lady.", "When does she leave?"]
["She approached the captain of the main-top.", "When does the Narcissus leave?"]
["To-morrow, mistress--she leaves at 'igh tide tomorrow.", "With an eye for a fee or a bribe, he drew a little away from the others, and said to her in a low tone: \"Is there anything what I could do for you, mistress?"]
["I--I have a r-relative\"--she hesitated at the word--\"in the navy.", "'Ave you now, yer leddyship?"]
["She seemed to be sinking, sinking--There was a knocking, knocking at the door of the cabin, and a voice calling to her--how far away it seemed!...", "Was she dying, was she drowning?"]
["She shuddered.", "Why should the dead hand tap at her door?"]
["For an instant she did not know where she was.", "Was it a dream still?"]
["He tapped still louder.", "Guida, don't you hear me?"]
["Then she opened it slowly, and her white face showed.", "O Philip,\" she said breathlessly, \"why have you frightened me so?"]
["We are sailing to-morrow--there's no doubt about it this time.\"", "\"O Philip,\" she answered, her voice quivering, \"how can I?"]
["I can't kiss you good-bye where you are.\"", "Must I come to you?"]
["You ought not to have come; you have broken your promise.\"", "Are you not glad to see me?"]
["No, no, Philip, no; not really so until all the world is told.", "My beloved Guida, what difference can that make?"]
["Guida's face crimsoned.", "What--how much did Maitresse Aimable know?", "By what necromancy had this fat, silent fisher-wife learned the secret which was the heart of her life, the soul of her being--which was Philip?"]
["Can you guess who it is?"]
["Ah bah, so it goes!\"", "Who is it, then?"]
["Eh ben, that is the thing!", "How can you tell that one is in love, Maitresse Aimable?"]
["The eyes of the two met now, fairly, firmly; and Guida was conscious of a look in the other's face which she had never seen before.", "Had then a new sight been given to herself?"]
["She could feel the huge breast heave, she felt the vast face turn hot, she was conscious of a voice struggling back to life, and she heard it say at last: \"Gatd'en'ale, rosemary tea cures a cough, but nothing cures the love--ah bah, so it goes!\"", "Do you love Jean?"]
["Maitresse Aimable's face grew hotter; she did not speak, but patted Guida's back with her heavy hand and nodded complacently.", "Have you always loved him?"]
["She herself seemed to read Maitresse Aimable all at once--read her by virtue, and in the light, of true love, the primitive and consuming feeling in the breast of each for a man.", "Were not words necessary for speech after all?", "But here she stopped short suddenly; for if love might find and read love, why was it she needed speech of Philip?"]
["Of course Philip loved her deeply.", "Had she not seen the light of true love in his eyes, and felt the arms of love about her?"]
["Why had Philip failed to keep his promise not to see her again after the marriage, till he should return from Portsmouth?"]
["Why, even though she had been foolish in her request--why had he not done as she wished?", "Was that love--was it love to break the first promise he had ever made to his wife?"]
["If Philip were only here to resolve these fears, these perplexities, to quiet the storm in her!", "And yet, could he--could he?"]
["She had a thrill of excitement, for this man was privy to her secret, he was connected with her life history.", "What he might yet be, who could tell?"]
["Suddenly a new thought came to her.", "Suppose that Philip should rise to high places, would she be able to follow?", "What had she seen--what did she know--what social opportunities had been hers?", "How would she fit with an exalted station?"]
["Then there were Corneille, Shakespeare, Petrarch, Cervantes--she had read them all; and even Wace, the old Norman trouvere, whose Roman de Rou she knew almost by heart.", "Was she so very ignorant?"]
["It's the people who try to be clever who never are; the people who are clever never think of trying to be.\"", "Was Philip right?", "Was she really, in some way, a little bit clever?"]
["She, drew back from it because she wanted to empty out her heart, and yet, somehow, she dared not.", "She wanted to tell Philip all the feelings that possessed her; but how dared she write just what she felt: love and bitterness, joy and indignation, exaltation and disappointment, all in one?", "How was it these could all exist in a woman's heart at once?", "Was it because Love was greater than all, deeper than all, overcame all, forgave all?", "and was that what women felt and did always?", "Was that their lot, their destiny?", "Must they begin in blind faith, then be plunged into the darkness of disillusion, shaken by the storm of emotion, taste the sting in the fruit of the tree of knowledge--and go on again the same, yet not the same?"]
["At last Guida noticed Jean's look.", "What is it that you see, Maitre Jean?"]
["Guida's fingers suddenly clinched rigidly upon the tiller.", "\"War?"]
["Her lips smiled.", "For what can long depress the youthful and the loving when they dream that they are entirely beloved?"]
["And who shall cry out against that egotism with which all are diseased?"]
["She shivered a little, she scarcely knew why, for it did not then seem of consequence to her whether Mr. Dow went or stayed, though he had never given her the marriage certificate.", "Indeed, was it not better he should go?"]
["Guida looked about her.", "Was it all a dream-all that had happened to her, and around her?"]
["To-day-she sighed.", "Long after they put out to sea again she could still hear the affrighted cry of the peasants from the cliff-or was it only the plaintive echo of her own thoughts?"]
["\"No, no, Duke, just where I have marked,\" interposed the Minister.", "Most curious,\" he said after a moment, making little nods of his head towards Dalbarade; \"my own name--and an English prisoner, you say?"]
["I never heard of an English branch of our family.\"", "But suppose he were English, yet French too?"]
["\"I am no reader of riddles, monsieur,\" he said acidly, although eager to know more concerning this Englishman of the same name as himself, ruler of the sovereign duchy of Bercy.", "Shall I bid him enter, Prince?"]
["The Duke's face relaxed a little, for the truth was, at this moment of his long life he was deeply concerned with his own name and all who bore it.", "Is he here then?"]
["The warm sunlight of spring, streaming through the window, was now upon his pale face, and strengthened it, giving it fulness and the eye fire.", "How long have you been a prisoner, monsieur?"]
["Vilely, monseigneur,\" answered the other; \"a shipwrecked enemy should never be made prisoner, or at least he should be enlarged on parole; but I have been confined like a pirate in a sink of a jail.", "Of what country are you?"]
["Monsieur is of England, then?"]
["The Duke was a trifle nettled.", "Where were you born, monsieur?"]
["\"I come of Norman stock too, monsieur,\" remarked the Duke graciously, yet eyeing the young man keenly.", "Monseigneur has not the kindred advantage of being English?"]
["The Duke protested with a deprecatory wave of the fingers and a flash of the sharp eyes, and then, after a slight pause, said: \"What is your name, monsieur?\"", "Philip d'Avranche,\" was the brief reply; then with droll impudence: \"And monseigneur's, by monseigneur's leave?"]
["The young man's quick, watchful eyes fixed themselves like needles on the Duke's face.", "Through his brain there ran a succession of queries and speculations, and dominating them all one clear question-was he to gain anything by this strange conversation?", "Who was this great man with a name the same as his own, this crabbed nobleman with skin as yellow as an orange, and body like an orange squeezed dry?"]
["The Duke's kinsman!", "Had the Duke then got his release on the ground that they were of kin--a kinship which, even to be authentic, must go back seven centuries for proof?"]
["No word was spoken till they entered the carriage and were driven swiftly away.", "Whither now, your Highness?"]
["He came to know the gossip gone abroad that the Duke had already chosen him for heir.", "A fantastic rumour, maybe, yet who could tell?"]
["They shall not feed upon these lands of the d'Avranches, they shall not carouse at my table when I am gone and the fool I begot has returned to his Maker.", "The fault of him was never mine, but God's--does the Almighty think we can forget that?"]
["\"Last night in the chapel I spake to God and I said: 'Lord God, let there be fair speech between us.", "Wherefore hast Thou nailed me like a malefactor to the tree?"]
["Philip's first motion was to stand up and say: \"I dare not think your Highness means in very truth to make me your kinsman in the succession.\"", "And why not, why not?"]
["Then he added more kindly: \"Why not--come, tell me that, cousin?"]
["He said the last words slowly, for, whatever else he was, he was a loyal English sailor, and he wished the Duc de Bercy to know it, the more convincingly the better for the part he was going to play in this duchy, if all things favoured.", "Tut, tut, what has that to do with it?"]
["\"What has poverty to do with blood?"]
["The Duke's lips compressed as though in anger.", "\"You mean to say, monsieur, that you would let this wretched war between France and England stand before our own kinship and alliance?", "What are you and I in this great shuffle of events?"]
["Certainly there was nothing immoral in his ambitions.", "If the reigning Prince chose to establish him as heir, who had a right to complain?"]
["On the visitor announcing himself as a Vaufontaine, this curiosity gave place to as keen surprise; he was admitted with every mark of respect, and the gates closed behind him.", "Has his Highness any visitors?"]
["Who are they?"]
["No, monsieur, a d'Avranche.", "\"What d'Avranche?"]
["No, monsieur, the name is the same as his Highness's.", "\"Philip d'Avranche?"]
["About the same age as monsieur.", "How does he occupy himself?"]
["Is he a soldier?"]
["The visitor drew from his pocket a second gold piece, and, slipping it into the other's hand, said: \"Tell it all at once.", "Who is the gentleman, and what is his business here?"]
["What a fool are you to babble thus!", "How d'ye know but I'm one of Fouche's or Barere's men?"]
["\"My dear Frange Pergot,\" said he, \"that's the man I knew once, and the sort of man that's been fighting with me for the Church and for the King these months past in the Vendee.", "Come, come, don't you know me, Pergot?"]
["With the memory of past feuds and hatreds in his mind, and predisposed against any Vaufontaine, his greeting was courteously disdainful, his manner preoccupied.", "Remarking that he had but lately heard of monsieur le comte's return to France, he hoped he had enjoyed his career in--was it then England or America?"]
["Had monsieur le comte then spent all these years in the Channel Isles--a prisoner perhaps?", "No?"]
["It was the heyday of the cause.", "And how does all this concern me?"]
["Yours is of the noblest names in France.", "Will you not stand openly for what you cannot waver from in your heart?"]
["The Duke never took his eyes from Detricand's.", "What was going on behind that parchment face, who might say?", "Are you aware,\" he answered Detricand at last, \"that I could send you straight from here to the guillotine?"]
["So he had been human enough to try and force open the door of mystery by a biting suggestion; for he had a feeling that in the presence of the mysterious kinsman, Philip d'Avranche, lay the cause of the Duke's resistance to his prayer.", "Who was this Philip d'Avranche?"]
["Detricand smiled.", "I have drawn the Norman-Jersey cousin, then?"]
["So saying, he bowed, and, turning, left the room.", "What meant the fellow by his Place du Vier Prison?"]
["Who knows, monsieur le duc?"]
["\"A form, monsieur le duc, a mere form.", "Monsieur\"--he bowed towards Philip politely--\"monsieur is not already married?"]
["For an instant there was absolute stillness.", "Philip had felt his heart give one great thump of terror: Did the Intendant know anything?"]
["He took a step nearer to the table, and, drawing himself up, looked his princely interlocutor steadily in the eyes.", "Of course there is no marriage--no woman?"]
["Did he mean that to comfort her, she asked herself.", "Did he mean it to divert her from the pain of the separation, to give her something to hope for?"]
["It was all Philip, Philip full of hope, purpose, prowess, ambition.", "Did he think--did he think that that could ease the pain, could lighten the dark day settling down on her?", "Could he imagine that anything might compensate for his absence in the coming months, in this year of all years in her life?", "His lengthened absence might be inevitable, it might be fate, but could he not see the bitter cruelty of it?"]
["If he had married her secretly and left her at the altar, so keeping the vow he had made her when she promised to become his wife, that might have been pardonable.", "But to marry her as he did, and then, breaking his solemn pledge, leave her--it was not right in her eyes; and if not right in the eyes of her who loved him, in whose would it be right?"]
["Guida realised now that she must announce the marriage at once.", "But what proofs of it had she?"]
["That seemed no weighty matter, for many sailors had made love to Carterette in her time, and knowing it was here to-day and away to-morrow with them, her heart had remained untouched.", "Why then should she think Guida would take the officer seriously where she herself held the sailor lightly?"]
["Guess who's wrote me a letter?"]
["Nannin, ma'm'selle, 'tis plain to be seen you can't guess what a cornfield grows besides red poppies.", "Laughing in sheer delight at the mystery she was making, she broke off again into a whimsical nursery rhyme: \"'Coquelicot, j'ai mal au de Coquelicot, qu'est qui l'a fait?"]
["She guessed whom Carterette meant.", "Has Monsieur Detricand more buttons now?"]
["Instantly Guida thought of Philip and a kind of envy shot into her heart that this idler Detricand should mount so high in a few months--a man whose past had held nothing to warrant such success.", "A general--where?"]
["\"Good riddance to Monsieur Savary dit Detricand, and good welcome to the Comte de Tournay,\" answered Guida, trying hard to humour Carterette, that she should sooner hear the news yet withheld.", "And what follows after?"]
["In the slight pause Carterette made, a hundred confused torturing thoughts swam through her mind and presently floated into the succeeding sentences of the letter: \"'As for me, I'm like Rabot's mare, I haven't time to laugh at my own foolishness.", "You wouldn't have expected that, my friend with the tongue that stings, would you?"]
["Carterette paused again, saying in an aside: \"That is M'sieu' all over, all so gay.", "But who knows?"]
["She rubbed them hard.", "\"The poor child of heaven--what has come over you?"]
["CHAPTER XXVII In the Rue d'Driere, the undertaker and his head apprentice were right merry.", "But why should they not be?"]
["Burying was a trade, and wherefore should not one--discreetly--be cheerful at one's trade?"]
["said the Master of Burials, as the second account was laid aside, duly approved.", "Eh ben, now let's hear the next--who is it?"]
["was his snarling comment.", "What about those turnips from Denise Gareau, numskull?"]
["\"All the world staring, and good reason,\" he added.", "And she scarce winking, eh?"]
["Rubbing his hands, and drawing his lean leg up till it touched his nose, he looked over it with avid eyes, and said: \"How much--don't read the items, but come to total debit--how much she pays me?\"", "Shan't you make it one hundred and twenty-one livres?"]
["With a hungry instinct for the morbid they stole to the doorway and looked down the Rue d'Driere after her.", "The Master was sympathetic, for had he not in his fingers at that moment a bill for a hundred and twenty livres odd?"]
["Maybe it was a native cruelty which had a sort of sardonic pleasure in the miseries of the world.", "Or was it only the perception, sometimes given to the dullest mind, of the futility of goodness, the futility of all?"]
["Once I thought you true, and this letter you send would have me still believe so.", "Do you then think so ill of my intelligence?"]
["You, who knew the open book of her heart, you threw it in the dust.", "Of course there is no wife?"]
["You told your lie without pity.", "Were you blind that you did not see the consequences?", "Did you not realise it, or were you so wicked that you did not care?"]
["How dared you rob me of all that was my birthright, of all that was my life, and give me nothing--nothing in return!", "Do you remember how I begged you not to make me marry you; but you urged me, and because I loved you and trusted you, I did?", "how I entreated you not to make me marry you secretly, but you insisted, and loving you, I did?", "how you promised you would leave me at the altar and not see me till you came again to claim me openly for your wife, and you broke that sacred promise?"]
["Do you remember that night in the garden when the wind came moaning up from the sea?"]
["When my miseries first fell upon me, I thought that I must die.", "Why should I live on--why should I not die?"]
["This is a last farewell between us.", "Do you remember what you said to me on the Ecrehos?"]
["I should deserve that if ever I deceived you, Guida.\"", "Will you ever think of that, in your vain glory hereafter?"]
["he added roughly as she moved on, and his greyish-yellow face had an evil joy at thought of the brutal work in hand.", "Who are you?"]
["With a leer the fellow stooped, and, taking up the fish, put them in the pockets of his queminzolle, all slimy from the sea as they were.", "\"Ba su, you haven't got much to take care of, have you?"]
["he said, patting its head with his big hand.", "Watching and waiting, eh, old Biribi?"]
["The child did not quite understand.", "Please?"]
["O Guilbert, is that what you should say?"]
["The child looked up quaintly at her, and with the same whimsical smile which Guida had given to another so many years ago, he looked at Ranulph and said: \"Pardon, monsieur.\"", "Coum est qu'on etes, m'sieu'?"]
["Under his directions, Jean Touzel had removed the few things that Guida took with her to Plemont; and instructed by him, Elie Mattingley sold her furniture.", "Your father--how is he?"]
["She looked at him half sadly, half curiously.", "You--you haven't any ambitions now, Maitre Ranulph?"]
["Of late she had sometimes wondered if, after all, she had had the right to do as she had done in accepting the public shame, and in not proclaiming the truth: if to act for one's own heart, feelings, and life alone, no matter how perfect the honesty, is not a sort of noble cruelty, or cruel nobility; an egotism which obeys but its own commandments, finding its own straight and narrow path by first disbarring the feelings and lives of others.", "Had she done what was best for the child?"]
["Was life then but a series of trist condonings at the best, of humiliating compromises at the worst?"]
["You haven't ambition any longer?"]
["Her heart suddenly stopped beating.", "What was Ranulph going to say?", "After all these years was he going to speak of Philip?"]
["Have people played false in your life--ever?"]
["\"Wait, wait,\" she said in trepidation.", "It--it has nothing to do with me?"]
["\"It has only to do with my father and myself.", "When I've told you, then you must say whether you will have anything to do with it, or with me.... You remember,\" he continued, without waiting for her to speak, \"you remember that day upon the Ecrehos--five years ago?"]
["I didn't--why?"]
["\"Ranulph, Ranulph,\" she broke in, \"you must not speak of this now!", "Do you not see it hurts me?"]
["\"Go on,\" she said helplessly.", "What have you to say, Ranulph?"]
["As I hammered away at my ships month in month out, year in year out, the truth came home to me at last.", "What right had I to sit down and brood over my miseries?"]
["You and I are apart from the world, a black loneliness no one understands.", "Let us be lonely no longer.", "Let us live our lives together.", "What shall we care for the rest of the world if we know we mean to do good and no wrong?"]
["\"Me--I have always forgotten--everything,\" he answered.", "\"Have you thought that for all these years I've believed one word?"]
["You stopped me, you would not listen.", "Perhaps you've thought I did not know what has happened to you every week, almost every day of your life?"]
["I was either a girl who--who deserved nothing of the world, or I was a wife.", "I had no husband, had I?"]
["\"Only for that, Ranulph,\" she answered.", "When will you claim the child's rights?"]
["she exclaimed.", "\"Whom has he wronged?"]
["Then a new thought came to him.", "Do you think your not speaking all these years was best for the child?"]
["I would rather have died than--\" She stopped short.", "No, not even to this man who knew all could she speak her whole mind; but sometimes the thought came to her with horrifying acuteness: was it possible that she ought to have sunk her own disillusions, misery, and contempt of Philip d'Avranche, for the child's sake?"]
["Stooping, she kissed the little fellow upon the forehead and the eyes, and his two hands came up and clasped both her cheeks.", "Tu m'aimes, maman?"]
["As he held out his hand to Guida the child leaned over and touched him on the shoulder.", "What is your name, man?"]
["He spoke scarcely above a whisper.", "Tcheche--what's that?"]
["He had not forgotten his father, but something held him here; as though Fate were whispering in his ear.", "What does it matter now?"]
["He must get his father clear of the island and that soon.", "But how?", "and where should they go?", "He had a boat in St. Aubin's Bay: getting there under cover of darkness he might embark with his father and set sail--whither?"]
["\"Don't be afraid, they shall not hang you,\" Ranulph replied quietly, and began warming his hands at the fire.", "You'll swear it, Ranulph--on the Bible?"]
["He had been open-handed, had stood by his friends, and, up to a few days ago, was counted a good citizen; for many had come to profit through him.", "His trade--a little smuggling, a little piracy?", "Was not the former hallowed by distinguished patronage, and had it not existed from immemorial time?"]
["Somehow he could not feel that this was really the day of his death.", "Yet how could it be otherwise?"]
["He looked round on the crowd.", "Cowards--cowards,\" he cried, \"will you see him murdered?"]
["He turned on the crowd fiercely.", "Have you nothing to say to this butchery?"]
["For the love of God, haven't you anything to say?"]
["As in her mental maze she sat panting her way to enlightenment, she saw Guida's boat entering the little harbour.", "Now the truth must be told--but how?"]
["\"You always believed in me, 'tresse Aimable,\" Guida said at last in a low voice.", "Oui-gia, what else?"]
["If she gave her own life many times, it still could be no more than was the child's due.", "A sudden impulse seized her, and with a quick explosion of feeling she dropped on her knees, and looking into his eyes, as though hungering for the words she so often yearned to hear, she said: \"You love your mother, Guilbert?"]
["\"You shall have the sword too some day,\" she answered, her eyes flashing.", "But, maman, can't I touch it now?"]
["I can't take the sword out, can I, maman?"]
["Not yet, my son, not yet.", "I has to be growed up so the blade doesn't hurt me, hasn't I, maman?"]
["She turned to him; the little figure was erect with a sweet importance.", "Maman, what am I now--with the sword?"]
["She felt her heart stand still suddenly, and with a tremor, as of fear, she gathered her child close to her.", "What is all those ships, maman?"]
["\"They are ships to defend Jersey,\" she said, watching the Imperturbable and its flotilla range on.", "Will they affend us, maman?"]
["Now, he was again brought face to face with his past; with the imminent memory of Guida Landresse de Landresse.", "Where was Guida now?", "What had happened to her?"]
["There, with a wild eloquence, he had made a girl believe he loved her, and had taken the first step in the path which should have led to true happiness and honour.", "From this good path he had violently swerved--and now?"]
["Walking through the Place du Vier Prison, he recalled the morning when he had rescued Ranulph from the hands of the mob.", "Where was Ranulph now?"]
["He cared to hear of no one but Guida, and who was now to mention her name to him?"]
["How many years ago was it?"]
["He had shrunk from coming here, but it had been far worse than he had looked for.", "One day, in a nervous, bitter moment, after an impatient hour with the Comtesse, he had said: \"Can you--can you not speak?"]
["And not myself only has felt that.", "I never told you--but you remember the day the old Duke died, the day we were married?"]
["That meant that he was afraid, that death had cleared his sight as to you in some way.", "He was afraid--of what?", "And I have been afraid--of what?"]
["Having at last discovered his real self a little, he was in the way of knowing others.", "May I shut the door?"]
["They had spoken no word since his entrance.", "She--she is not dead?"]
["They shook their heads again.", "Her grandfather\"--he paused--\"is he living?"]
["Where is mademoiselle?"]
["Jean looked at his wife; neither moved nor answered.", "Where does she live?"]
["\"You speak to me with soft words,\" she said harshly--\"but you shall have the good hard truth from me.", "You want to know now where she is--I ask where you have been these five years?"]
["\"As many witnesses as you will, but not now, not this hour, after all these years.", "Will you not at least listen to me, and then judge and act?"]
["Well, since it had gone so far she would speak openly, though it hurt her sense of self-respect.", "\"For that matter, do you think that I or any good woman would have had place or power, been princess or duchess, at the price?"]
["Were it otherwise, were you not from first to last unworthy, would you have--but no, your worst crime need not be judged here.", "Yet had you one spark of worthiness would you have made a mock marriage--it is no more--with the Comtesse Chantavoine?"]
["Dressed in molleton, with no adornment save the glow of a perfect health, she seemed at this moment, as on the Ecrehos, the one being on earth worth living and caring for.", "What had he got for all the wrong he had done her?"]
["You are not the kind of man with whom a woman could trust herself in the troubles and changes of life.", "Laying all else aside, if I would have had naught of your honours and your duchy long ago, do you think I would now share a disgrace from which you could never rise?"]
["He nodded at Detricand.", "\"I have not tasted wine these five years,\" he said; then added, \"You--you took too much wine in Jersey, did you not, monsieur?"]
["His eyes again caught the cross and heart on Detricand's coat, and they lighted up a little.", "The Lord hath triumphed gloriously,\" he repeated, and added irrelevantly, \"I suppose you are almost a captain now?"]
["Mr. Dow half raised himself on his couch, and the fevered eyes swallowed Detricand.", "You--you are a prince, monsieur?"]
["\"It is through a melancholy chance you see me at all,\" replied Detricand heavily.", "To what piteous accident am I indebted?"]
["\"Were not my reasons for surrender sound?"]
["Detricand's eyes flashed fire.", "Why then permit the murder, monsieur le general?"]
["Now count them all over--de la Rochejaquelein, Bonchamp, d'Elbee, Lescure, Stofflet, Charette, Talmont, Tinteniac, Sombreuil, Vaufontaine--they are all gone, your great men.", "And who of chieftains and armies are left?"]
["As Grandjon-Larisse read, an oath broke from him.", "Is this authentic, monseigneur?"]
["The Comtesse Chantavoine was the one person outwardly unmoved.", "What she thought, who could tell?"]
["A l'aide, mon Prince, on me fait tort!\"", "What did she mean, this woman with the exquisite face, alive with power and feeling, indignation and appeal?", "To what prince did she cry?--for what aid?"]
["Guida rose to her feet.", "What Philip d'Avranche, mademoiselle?"]
["He was stolen from me by Philip d'Avranche, Duc de Bercy.\"", "What proof have you that it was the Duc de Bercy?"]
["You make its intent this, you make it that, but nothing can alter the law, and what has been done in its name for generations.", "and you will take heed?", "But when it is blood of my blood, bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh that he has wickedly seized; when it is the head I have pillowed on my breast for four years--the child that has known no father, his mother's only companion in her unearned shame, the shame of an outcast--then is it so that your law of Haro may not apply?"]
["The Court was in a greater maze than ever.", "Was he then about to restore to Guida her child?"]
["H'm--Lorenzo Dow is well out of the way-have done.", "May I not then be heard in my own defence?"]
["The jurats whispered to each other.", "Who are you, monsieur?"]
["Guida's eyes were upon the Bailly.", "And the child?"]
["\"Mattingley will fight you just the same,\" answered Ranulph coolly.", "Oh ho, you know these people, my gunner?"]
["\"You Jersey folk were once Frenchmen, and now that you're French again, you shall do something for the flag.", "You see that 12-pounder yonder to the right?"]
["\"A good aim,\" he heard Richambeau say, jerking a finger backward towards him.", "Was it then?", "said Ranulph to himself; was it indeed?"]
["Neither would it do to make for the woods of the interior, for still Richambeau might revenge himself on the fishing-post.", "What was to be done?"]
["While the long minutes went by, a voice kept calling up from below; calling, calling, at first eagerly, then anxiously, then with terror.", "By and by the bundle of life stirred, took shape, raised itself, and was changed into a man again, a thinking, conscious being, who now understood the meaning of this sound coming up from the earth below--or was it the sea?"]
["Now he knew, and he answered down: \"All right, all right, garche Carterette!\"", "Are you at the top?"]
["I'll soon be there.", "Are you hurt, Ranulph?"]
["Surely such travail had been more than mortal.", "And what was this vast fluttering over his head, this million-voiced discord round him, like the buffetings and cries of spirits welcoming another to their torment?"]
["\"You must help Sebastian Alixandre up,\" she said.", "\"Sebastian Alixandre--is he there?"]
["No, it was impossible.", "Yet, what was that?"]
["What had sprung up in his heart for Carterette belonged to the new life.", "In this new land there was work to do--what might he not accomplish here?"]
["That evening he went to Carterette and asked her to be his wife.", "She turned pale, and, looking up into his eyes with a kind of fear, she said brokenly: \"It's not because you feel you must?", "It's not because you know I love you, Ranulph--is it?"]
["Philip was heir by adoption only, and the inheritance had been secured at the last by help of a lie--surely his was a righteous cause!", "His motives had not their origin in hatred of Philip alone, nor in desire for honours and estates for himself, nor in racial antagonism, for had he not been allied with England in this war against the Government?"]
["I do not mistake myself, Chevalier [he wrote], nor these late doings of mine.", "What credit shall I take to myself for coming to place and some little fame?"]
["What praise shall I take for this?"]
["Tired of the husks and the swine, and all his follies grown stale by over-use, he takes the advice of a good gentleman, and joins the standard of work and sacrifice.", "What greater luxury shall man ask?", "If this be not running the full scale of life's enjoyment, pray you what is?"]
["Everything is with the returned prodigal--the more so if he be of the notorious Vaufontaines, who were ever saints turned sinners, or sinners turned saints.", "Tell me, my good friend, where is room for pride in me?"]
["\"Perfectly--and without the glove, monsieur le general,\" answered Philip quietly.", "Where shall my seconds wait upon you?"]
["Grandjon-Larisse was turning away when Philip called him back.", "Will you carry my profound regret to the Countess Chantavoine?"]
["he gasped.", "Grandjon-Larisse inclined his head, then after a moment, gravely said: \"What did you think was left for a woman--for a Chantavoine?"]
["This was Manon Moignard the witch.", "Man doux d'la vie, where's the Master of Burials?"]
["\"A full belly's a full belly if it's only full of straw,\" snapped Manon Moignard.", "Who was it brought him home?"]
["\"Pardi, that's it,\" answered the centenier.", "\"Why did Detricand Duke turn Philip Duke out of duchy, see him killed, then fetch him home to Jersey like a brother?"]
["\"Those great folks does things their own ways; oui-gia,\" remarked the jailer.", "Why did Detricand Duke go back to France?"]
["The child nodded his head gleefully, and his big eyes blinked with understanding.", "Doesn't it ever stop?"]
["\"I like watches,\" said the child sententiously.", "Would you like this one?"]
["The man did not answer the last question.", "You like it?"]
["She came forward eagerly.", "Is it--is it that indeed, the watch that the dear grandpethe--?"]
["\"Perhaps he knows his wish was fulfilled,\" answered Guida.", "You think, then, that I've kept my promise?"]
["To his ear there was in her voice a little touch--not of bitterness, but of something, as it were, muffled or reserved.", "Was she thinking how he had robbed her child of the chance of heritage at Bercy?"]
["There you are, monseigneur!", "Why do you call him monseigneur?"]
["A look half-amused, half-perplexed, crossed over Detricand's face.", "Do you think so?"]
["and added quickly, \"you shall have it when you're grown up.\"", "Do you really mean it?"]
["It is the face of your godmother, the Duchess Guidabaldine.\"", "What should one do here with rubies and diamonds?"]
["Her clear unwavering eye looked steadfastly at him, but her face turned pale.", "Why do you call him monseigneur the heir to the duchy of Bercy?"]
["Then stepping back a little, and looking earnestly at Guida, he added with a motion of the hand towards the child: \"You must learn the truth from him.\"", "Oh, what can you mean--what can you mean?"]
["Dropping upon her knees, and running an arm round the child, she opened the parchment and read.", "What--what right has he to this?"]
["\"I am only Detricand of Vaufontaine,\" he answered.", "\"What, did you--could you think that I would dispossess your child?"]
["She suddenly saw all Detricand's goodness to her stretch out in a long line of devoted friendship, from this day to that far-off hour seven years before, when he had made a vow to her--kept how nobly!", "Devoted friendship--was it devoted friendship alone, even with herself?"]
["\"This was the gage,\" he said, holding it up.", "Do you remember the day I came to return it to you, and carried it off again?"]
["But suppose the child in after years should blame you?"]
["Suppose that Guilbert should say, What right had you, my mother, to refuse what was my due?"]
["It smote her heart now.", "What right had she to reject this gift of Fate to her child?", "Scarcely above a whisper she replied: \"Of course he might say that, but how, oh, how should we simple folk, he and I, be fitted for these high places--yet?"]
["She turned to him frankly, she looked at him steadfastly, the colour in her face came and went, but her eyes glowed with feeling.", "After all that has happened?"]
["It is because you--you have suffered, because you know, that I come.", "Out of your miseries, the convict's lagging step, you say?"]
["\"You must give me chance and right to serve him.", "What else have you or I to look forward to?"]
["interrupted Jean.", "\"What is the news, my wife?"]
["Eh ben = eh bien.", "Es-tu gentiment?", "= are you well?"]
["Su' m'n ame = sur mon ame!", "Tcheche?", "= what's that you say?"]
["\"I am ready,\" answered Roger, still, however, lingering and watching the ship in the offing.", "But tell me, what cause brought you to Eversden this morning?"]
["\"You are late, lads,\" said the Colonel, looking first at one, then at the other, in a somewhat stern manner.", "You know the rules of the house--how comes it?"]
["Since the noble Blake commanded the fleets of England, such gentry have not dared to venture into the English Channel.", "And are you also going, Master Battiscombe?"]
["\"Master Thomas Handscombe, cloth-merchant of London, who has just come down from thence, craves to see Mr Roger Willoughby,\" he said.", "Do you know him?"]
["Master Handscombe, though a man of grave deportment, had no objection to hear himself speak.", "When did you leave London?"]
["Truly you have reason to be thankful,\" observed Mr Willoughby; \"for it is a long time since I made a journey to London, and, of my own free will, I will never again undertake it.", "And what news do you bring from the city?"]
["How go matters at Court?"]
["Be that as it may, many persons speak boldly of the Duke of Monmouth some day becoming King of England.\"", "What is your opinion, Master Handscombe?"]
["The one rules it like the lordly lion, and strikes down with his powerful paw all opponents; the other creeps forward gently and noiselessly like the cat,--not the less resolved, however, to destroy his prey.\"", "You would then rather see the Duke of Monmouth than the Duke of York king of England?"]
["I ran on to announce him, and he and Stephen will be here anon.\"", "But who is your friend?"]
["The wind howled and whistled and shrieked among the surrounding trees, the thunder roared, the lightning flashed, the rain came down in torrents.", "Which way does the wind blow, think you?"]
["Such a gale as this is sufficient to drive even a stouter ship than the _Benbow_ frigate from her anchors; but we must wait patiently till the morning to ascertain the truth.", "Why should that be?"]
["They put on their thick overcoats; fortunately Stephen had left his some days before at the manor-house.", "Who goes there?"]
["Whither are you going, lads, on such a night as this?"]
["But I propose that we first visit Ben Rullock's cottage, and get him and his boy to help us; he will know whereabouts the ship lies.", "But you do not think we can go off to the ship in his boat?"]
["Again and again he and Stephen shouted and knocked louder and louder.", "Who's there wanting me at this hour of the morning?"]
["In vain the lads gazed along the whole line of the horizon extending from the Bill of Portland to the Start--not a sail was visible.", "She will not be coming back here, you may depend on?"]
["The Duke, apparently much astonished, started up.", "Why did you do that, good woman?"]
["It proves one of two things, either that the Duke of Monmouth is the lawful son of Charles the Second, or that imagination must have had a powerful influence on the poor woman, for it is here stated that in two days she was perfectly well.", "Is it not possible that there may not be a third solution to the mystery?"]
["You have outgrown a good lot of them, I should think,\" remarked Stephen; \"and we will at once pay a visit to Mr Tape, who will know more or less what you require.", "But how are they to be paid for?"]
["When Roger saw the Captain and his mates bring up their quadrants on deck just before noon to make an observation, he brought up his, and began in a methodical way to make preparations for taking one also.", "What, youngster, have you been at sea before?"]
["Roger told him.", "\"What, from old Trickett?"]
["It was a great advantage to him and Stephen to have fine weather for so long a period, though they made but slow progress on their voyage, but it enabled them to gain experience far more easily than they would have done had the sea been rough and the ship tumbling about.", "When, Captain Roberts, think you, shall we be into the Mediterranean?"]
["The _Dolphin_, close-hauled under larboard tack, stood towards the African coast.", "What about Algerine corsairs, the Sallee rovers?"]
["Evening was approaching when the look-out from aloft shouted, \"A sail on the weather-bow.\"", "What does she look like?"]
["All sail which she could possibly carry was set, some hanging down from the yards, rigged across the bowsprit to the very water, while stud-sails were rigged out on the foremast, and the sheet of the huge mizzen was eased off, and the sail bulged out with the freshening breeze.", "What do you think of the stranger, sir?"]
["Many an eye was turned towards the stranger to ascertain if she was getting nearer.", "What do you think about it, Sam?"]
["We may keep ahead of her for some hours to come, always provided we do not carry anything away.\"", "But if she does come up with us, what shall we have to do?"]
["Still her after-guns were plied vigorously, though the enemy, again ranging up abreast, fired her broadsides in return.", "Are you hurt, sir?"]
["In the evening Jumbo brought supper to them, but he said that he was ordered not to hold any conversation, but to come away again as soon as he had placed the supper before them.", "But how is the ship going; what course is she steering?"]
["Stephen immediately hurried up with him.", "Who told you?"]
["\"From the Ouadelins, who carried me off from my father's camp,\" said the young Arab.", "But were your friends not pursuing?"]
["One of their leaders took up Selim behind him, the three others--Stephen, Roger, and Jumbo--in their fashion treating the white young men with great respect; then, turning their camels' heads, they again set off at full speed northwards.", "I say, Stephen, how do you like it?"]
["\"This is not pleasant news,\" observed Stephen, when Jumbo had translated what the chief said.", "Cannot we try to move the barbarian's heart?"]
["Jumbo was sitting up by their side.", "Who is this robber chief; have you been able to learn anything about him?"]
["\"You shall have the horses to ride on for your journey,\" he said.", "How are you to travel, Jumbo?"]
["Soon afterwards Jumbo on his return to their cell burst into tears.", "What is the matter?"]
["He started as he saw them, and stood gazing at them for some minutes.", "Who are you?"]
["Did you really get off with your lives from the robbers?", "Is it possible that you are Sam Stokes?"]
["Sam sat down and tried to look as much like a Moor as he could.", "How are you employed?"]
["We must show him that we do not intend to be treated in that way.\"", "What had we better do?"]
["\"Till we are set free,\" said Stephen.", "But how are we to get free?"]
["Cannot we devise some means of escaping?"]
["He will make officers of you and treat you well, and I do not suppose he expects you to fight.\"", "How could he know that we understood navigation?"]
["Of course, her Captain, who understood the use of the charts perfectly, afterwards told Roger to put it down, which he, having carefully taken his observation, did properly.", "How is this?"]
["Which of the two am I to believe?"]
["Follow our movements whatever happens; you are not expected to fight, so probably will not be missed.", "What do you think of her?"]
["That she is a stout English craft, likely not to give in without tough fighting; but she probably carries not more than thirty men, if so many, and we muster a hundred, so that she has very little chance if we run her alongside.", "But you don't mean to say that you fight your countrymen, Sam?"]
["There they are,\" cried the Captain, \"and at your service.", "How did you become possessed of them?"]
["Till he drew near they did not recognise the mud-bespattered, dust-covered traveller as their Captain, but he soon made himself known by his hearty cheer as he saw them.", "How fares it, lads, with you; how fares it?"]
["All right with the _Benbow_?"]
["Stephen and Roger walked the deck with her commander, who was in high spirits at the success of his voyage, for he had secured not only a good freight out and home, but had received a bag of gold and other presents from the King of Spain as a testimony to his gallantry.", "And are you two young men willing to continue to sail with me?"]
["The Captain hailed her.", "Where are you bound for?"]
["You are welcome to come on board if you visit us as a friend,\" he said, \"but I cannot allow you to step on my deck if you approach as an enemy.", "Whither are you bound, and to what nation do you belong?"]
["You, I see by the colours you carry, are French.\"", "What is the other vessel alongside you?"]
["\"At present, my friend, I think we are more likely to make you and your boat's crew prisoners,\" said Captain Benbow.", "\"See, you are under our guns, and I have only to give the word, and we can sink you in a moment; however, what do you say to a compromise?"]
["Who are you?"]
["\"John Benbow, at your service,\" answered the Captain.", "May I ask your name?"]
["Roger had been an interested listener to the conversation carried on in English, which Bart spoke remarkably well, as did Captain Coopman.", "Will you tell Captain Bart your adventure with the Moors' heads, sir?"]
["The stranger then stepping out advanced towards her, and once more bowed.", "Miss Alice Tufnell?"]
["He was a young man, tallish and thin, with a complexion burnt to a dark brown, his countenance showing that he had undergone toil, if not probably also sickness and suffering.", "How do you know my name?"]
["exclaimed the stranger.", "Is it possible?"]
["\"I knew you were not lost; I always said so.", "And Roger, my dear brother Roger, why has he not come with you?"]
["Madam Pauline was the first person they met, and she uttered an exclamation of surprise as she saw Mistress Alice approaching with a strange young gentleman, with whom she appeared on terms of intimacy.", "Who do you think he is, aunt?"]
["There can be little doubt,\" he added, \"therefore, that the ships we see belong to him, although they are fewer in number than I should have expected.\"", "Then is there to be a rebellion in this part of the country?"]
["Will the scenes I have read of in the time of Cromwell be again enacted?"]
["I would that war could be averted, but better to have war than to be tyrannically treated, our religious and civil rights trampled on as they have been for many years past; but, for my own part, I am ready to draw the sword in defence of our freedom.", "But can our freedom thus be secured?"]
["\"I promise you, Mistress Alice, not to draw sword unless in a righteous cause,\" said Stephen.", "Will that satisfy you?", "If the cause is righteous; but who is to settle that?"]
["\"I am loth to leave you,\" he said, \"but go I must.", "Tell me, will you return to Langton and consult your father before joining the Duke?"]
["\"I tell you I am sorry that you have so decided,\" answered Roger.", "Am I then to bear any message to your father except to say that you will not return home?", "Have you any other message?"]
["He was delayed here and there by having to answer numerous interrogations, and at length he reached the Hall, by which time it was nearly dark.", "What brings you here, Master Roger, and what has become of Stephen?"]
["Employ this evening in preparing your arms, and collecting such articles as you may require.", "Have you heard anything more about the ships Alice saw last night?"]
["It may be that he will gain the day, it may be that he will lose it; but certain it is that he who brings civil war into a land brings a heavy curse.", "And has Stephen actually joined the Duke of Monmouth?"]
["He was doubtful whether he should tell his uncle, but what would be the use, he thought, if they are Monmouth's men?--he would not join them.", "Or is it likely that the Duke could so soon have got an army together?"]
["Before you go you must take some refreshment, and I in the meantime will order a boat to be in waiting.\"", "Where snail I find the _Benbow_ frigate?"]
["I have made arrangements for the sale of your horse as your father requests me; here is the amount which the animal will probably fetch, put it in your pocket and do not throw it away; and now come along.", "What, are you going with me, sir?"]
["Though the day was long, it was dusk before they reached the _Ruby_ Shaking Roger by the hand, Mr Handscombe bade him answer the hail of the sentry, and then without loss of time stepped up the side with his valise.", "Are you not coming, sir?"]
["It had been proposed to fortify Taunton, but since its memorable siege, when defended by Blake, the walls and fortifications had been destroyed, and a considerable number of men would have been required for its defence.", "What can have come over the man?"]
["The answer was, \"The king.\"", "What king?"]
["\"We should have done it,\" he exclaimed at length, as they had to rein in their steeds while they ascended a steep hill.", "Done what?"]
["The next instant it was opened, and a grey-headed old man in a fisherman's dress appeared.", "What do you want here, master?"]
["\"By all means, my friend,\" said Stephen.", "And I suppose you can put our horses up in your boat-house?"]
["\"Travellers have need to look after their steeds for their own sakes.", "Are you riding northward?"]
["He was a big, broad-shouldered, black-bearded man.", "Whom have we here?"]
["The long summer's day was well-nigh closing in when they reached a hilly district, where they hoped to find concealment.", "What shall we do with our horses?"]
["They were not disappointed in the locality.", "Who can those men be?"]
["Should they fall, we shall be in an unpleasant predicament, and may chance to break our necks or limbs.\"", "Will you give your word that you will not attempt to escape, rescue or no rescue?"]
["\"Thank you for your frankness, sir,\" said Stephen.", "What do you say, Andrew; shall we give a promise not to escape, with a remote prospect of being rescued, and the tolerable certainty of being shot should we make the attempt to take advantage of it?"]
["We must run no small risk either way, and be prepared for it.\"", "Well, lads, have you made up your minds?"]
["\"If we had the power we would choose the latter course,\" said Stephen.", "May they not revenge themselves by imprisoning your father and destroying his farm?"]
["A superior-looking seafaring man opened it and bade him enter.", "Does the boat brought up in the bay belong to you, friend?"]
["I want to know whether you will let her to us for a couple of weeks or so.\"", "Where do you want to go to in her?"]
["The fellows have somehow or other found out who we are, and old Mr Headland will, I fear, be the sufferer.", "If those soldiers want us, should not we put back?"]
["For some hours the weather continued fine, and the boat made fair progress, but towards midnight a dark bank of clouds rose to the eastward, threatening a gale.", "What do you think of it, Joe?"]
["\"Very badly,\" they both answered.", "How soon is the gale likely to be over?"]
["A boat was lowered, and a lieutenant and midshipman came in her.", "What has brought you into this condition, friends?"]
["On the deck Stephen saw his old commander Captain Benbow, who, however, did not recognise him, dressed as he was in countryman's clothes.", "What brought you out here, my men, in mid-channel?"]
["They are not steering for Lyme,\" said Alice, \"but are coming on directly for our bay.", "Can they be the craft reported to have been fallen in with by the Lyme vessel?"]
["Stephen lifting his eyes recognised Alice; he bowed his head, and then cast his eyes again to the ground, as if he felt he had so completely disobeyed her wish that she could have no further interest in him.", "Where are you going to take these persons, my friends?"]
["The idea was no sooner suggested to Alice, than answering, \"That I will, thankfully,\" she started off at a fast pace across the Downs.", "What has happened?"]
["He started up in a moment.", "Can you forgive me?"]

["'Out into the world!", "Will you listen to the boy?", "Is it America you're thinking of?"]
["Isn't the best of all the boys and girls going to work for the strangers in the strange land?"]
["Again Hyacinth hesitated.", "Was it possible to give utterance to the thoughts and hopes which filled his mind?", "Could he tell anyone about the furious fancies of the last few days, or of that weird vision of his father's which lay at the back of what he felt and dreamed?", "Could he even speak of the enthusiasm which moved him to devote himself to the cause of freedom and a threatened nationality?"]
["What work is there for a man like me to do in Ireland?'", "'Don't I offer you the chance of buying Thady Durkan's boat?"]
["'But that's not the sort of work I ought to be doing.", "What good would it be to anyone but myself?"]
["Listen, now.", "Isn't the language dying on the people's lips?", "They're talking the English, more and more of them every day; and don't you know as well as I do that when they lose their Irish they'll lose half the good that's in them?", "What sort will the next generation of our people be, with their own language gone from them, and their Irish ways forgotten, and all the old tales and songs and tunes perished away like the froth of the waves that the storm blew up across the fields the night your father died?"]
["'You've listened to what I've told you, Father Moran, and you say that you understand what I feel, but I don't think you really do, or else you wouldn't fancy that I could be satisfied to stay here.", "What is it you ask of me?"]
["And why the noise of it vexed her I couldn't say, for she's as deaf as a post every time I speak to her.", "Ah, you're there, Michael, are you?"]
["He's got a head on his shoulders, and a notion of improving himself and his neighbours, and it would do you good to see him dance a jig.", "But why need I tell you that when you've seen him yourself?"]
["Well, a hundred years or so ago that boy's great-grandfather was swaggering about these same streets in a uniform, just as his descendant is doing now.", "He helped to drag a cannon into the Phoenix Park one day with a large placard tied over its muzzle--\"Our rights or----\" Who do you think he was threatening?"]
["'It is not likely'--she sighed as she spoke--'yet stranger things than that have happened.", "Have you ever considered what the present English policy in Ireland really is?", "Do you understand that they are trying to keep us quiet by bribing the priests?"]
["He bewildered himself in the effort to arrange the pieces of the game into some reasonable order.", "What was to be thought of a priesthood who, contrary to all the traditions of their Church, had nursed a revolution against the rights of property?", "or of a people, amazingly quick of apprehension, idealistic of temperament, who time after time submitted themselves blindfold to the tyranny of a single leader, worshipped a man, and asked no questions about his policy?", "How was he to place an aristocracy who refused to lead, and persisted in whining about their wrongs to the inattentive shopkeepers of English towns, gentlemen not wanting in honour and spirit courting a contemptuous bourgeoisie with ridiculous flatteries?", "In what reasonable scheme of things was it possible to place Protestants, blatant in their boasts about liberty, who hugged subjection to a power which deliberately fostered the growth of an ecclesiastical tyranny?", "Where amid this crazy dance of self-contradictory fanatics and fools was a sane man to find a place on which to stand?", "How, above all, was Ireland, a nation, to evolve itself?"]
["'Not know Doherty!", "How's that?"]
["'Well,' said Halloran, 'I was in one of the police-courts this morning doing my work for the _Evening Star_.", "You know I report the police news for that rag, don't you?"]
["'I should think the best punishment would be to send him out to Ladysmith.", "By the way, it would be rather funny if he met the other nine out there on a kopje, wouldn't it?"]
["I have enough by me to keep me going for a few weeks.'", "'But what about the men?"]
["'My dear boy,' she said, 'what seems plenty of money to you won't go very far in Paris.", "What is it?"]
["Mr. Conneally may be ready to start at a moment's notice, but he must at least pack up his tooth-brush.", "May we see you safe back to town, Miss O'Dwyer?"]
["'Oh, all this revolutionary business: the _Croppy_, seditious speeches, and now this rot about helping the Boers.", "What does she stand to gain by it?"]
["They think that every woman who doesn't mew about at afternoon parties must be a bad one.", "Now, anyone with a little experience would know at once that Miss Goold--what's this the other one called her?"]
["'Come, now, it can't be anything very bad at your age.", "Have you got into a mess with a girl?", "Or'--he brightened up at the guess--'are you hopelessly enamoured of the beautiful Finola?"]
["'Quite so.", "But seriously, now, what on earth do you expect to happen when you tell her?"]
["His anger began to give way to a sick feeling of disgust.", "'Think, now,' said the Captain: 'is it likely that you could enlist a corps of Sunday-school teachers for this kind of work?"]
["The British Isles will be too hot for me for a while.", "However, who can tell what might happen if I win a good medal from old Kruger, and capture a few British Generals?"]
["But that was impossible.", "How could he confess the degradation of his ideal?", "How could he resist the inevitable reminder that he had been warned beforehand?"]
["No, he must leave Dublin.", "But where to go?"]
["Hyacinth grew desperate.", "Could he go home, back to the fishing-boats and simple people of Carrowkeel?"]
["He felt for the letter in his pocket, and drew it out.", "After all, why should he not offer himself to James Quinn?"]
["I don't suppose anyone ever before was recommended for a post by a Protestant divinity professor, a notoriously violent political agitator, a Roman Catholic priest, and a--well, we won't describe my brother.", "How do you come to be mixed up with all these people?"]
["'We shall be having tea at half-past six,' said Mr. Quinn.", "'Will you come and join us?"]
["'I think,' said the Canon, 'that the question is decided for us.", "Is it not, Mr. Conneally?"]
["Clearly, if Canon Beecher was to be regarded as a type, she had no conception of the religious spirit of the Church of Ireland.", "But was there anyone else like this clergyman?"]
["It appeared that the committee of a bazaar for some charity in which it was right to be interested had issued a sort of examination-paper, and promised a prize to the best answerer.", "The questions were all of one kind: 'What is the Modern Athens--the Eternal City--the City of the Tribes?", "Who was the Wizard of the North--the Bulwark of the Protestant Faith?"]
["It seemed to him that all religions were in league against Ireland.", "Were the Protestants any better, when they spent \u00a320,000 a year on Chinamen and negroes?"]
["Now look inside.", "What have you?"]
["Most girls goad their young men to buy these cigarettes and make collections of the photos.", "Queer, isn't it?"]
["Mr. O'Reilly admitted as much.", "'But what am I to do?"]
["I'm a Catholic and a member of the League.", "What do you mean, you Souper, you Sour-face, by talking to me about Irish manufactures?"]
["'Yes, I admit that.", "But isn't that exactly what you want to make general?"]
["If I'm not hurried, I'll pull along all day.", "But what about you, Conneally?"]
["'That is quite possible,' he said.", "'But what can I do?"]
["'Perhaps I have no right to make the suggestion, but it seems to me that you are bound to be beaten.", "Would it not be better to give in at once?"]
["'I shall hold on,' said Mr. Quinn.", "'Ought you not to think of your wife?"]
["Again he looked at the elder girl, and this time was rewarded with a flash of defiant bitterness from her eyes.", "'Sorry, is it?"]
["And she got more than the rest of us.", "Wasn't she the first girl that Sister Mary Aloysius picked out of the school when the young lady from England came over to teach us?"]
["I worked for them for three years, and all I was getting at the end of it was six shillings a week.", "Why would I be working for that when I might be getting wages like Bridgy's in America?"]
["'Tell him I'll be there.'", "'Will you have your dinner before you go?"]
["Poverty like that in Dublin!", "Have you thought what it means?"]
["'My dear boy,' said Mr. Quinn, 'my wife and I have been trying all our lives to be Christians.", "Shall we receive good at the Lord's hand and not evil also?"]
["He was greatly pleased with the one about O'Dowd's cheap patriotism, and liked one or two of the others.", "He just asked one question about you: \"Does Mr. Conneally hate England and the Empire, and everything English, from the Parliament to the police barrack?"]
["Then a chilling doubt beset him suddenly.", "Did Marion know how poor he was?"]
["He could not answer her, although he knew that there was only one answer to her question.", "'Do you think that I love money?"]
["Hyacinth was astonished.", "How could anyone have guessed what he came about?", "Had Marion told her father already?"]
["Even the thought of the work he was to engage in with Miss Goold and Patrick O'Dwyer seemed to offer no ground for hesitation.", "Was he not enlisting with them to take part in the great battle?"]
["'Yes,' he said, 'I am on His side.'", "'And you love Marion?", "Are you quite sure of that?"]
["Mrs. Beecher was, indeed, the least worldly of women.", "Did she not marry the Canon, then a mere curate, on the slenderest income, and bear him successively five babies in defiance of common prudence?"]
["I always knew you had brains.", "But why did you never tell me what you were doing?"]
["You will at least listen to me patiently.'", "He took up Miss Goold's letter and searched through it for a short time; then he read aloud: '\"He just asked one question about you: Does Mr. Conneally hate England and the Empire and everything English, from the Parliament to the police barrack?"]
["It would be easier for me to give up the fight for Ireland, to desert the beaten side, to forget the lost cause.'", "He turned to Canon Beecher, speaking almost fiercely: 'Do you think it is a small thing for me to surrender your friendship, and perhaps--perhaps to lose Marion?"]
["He had chosen.", "Could he be sure that he had chosen right, that he knew the good side from the bad?"]
["When Hyacinth hung back, she left him for her husband, put her arms round his neck, and kissed him heartily on both cheeks.", "'Isn't it fortunate,' she said, 'that you saw Dr. Henry last week while you were in Dublin?"]
["We were talking about the Quinns.", "I told you that Mr. Quinn is to be the new secretary of the society, didn't I?"]
["Hyacinth started.", "Where had he heard those identical words before?"]
["Patrick O'Dwyer also had just asked one question about him.", "He smiled faintly as the Canon went on: '\"Is he fit, spiritually fit, to be ordained?"]
["And Marion is not afraid of being poor--are you, dear?'", "'That is just what I have been saying to him,' said Marion; 'isn't it, Hyacinth?"]
["Of all causes Ireland's seemed the most hopelessly lost.", "Was he, too, going to forsake her?"]
["Her eyes slowly travelled over him.", "After all, why should she, a humble nun, doubt his word when he said he was a priest?"]
["They spring from the cabins.", "What can you expect of them?"]
["Either way their influence was inconsiderable.", "Was there anyone else worth considering?"]
["The eldest isn't bad-looking.", "How is it all West of Ireland girls have such glorious complexions?"]
["'Now,' said Hyacinth, 'tell us what you are doing down here.", "They haven't made you an inspectress of boarded-out workhouse children, have they?"]
["'Oh,' said Hyacinth, 'you were at the convent function, I suppose.", "I wonder I didn't see you.'", "'What on earth were _you_ doing there?"]
["'Very well,' said Miss O'Dwyer; 'I'll talk seriously.", "When are you coming up to Dublin?"]
["The words of her poem, long since, he supposed, blotted from his memory, suddenly returned to him: 'O, desolate mother, O, Erin, When shall the pulse of thy life which but flutters in Connacht Throb through thy meadows and boglands and mountains and cities?'", "Had it come at last, this revival of the nation's vitality?", "Had it come just too late for him to share it?"]
["I am going to be ordained, to become an English curate.", "Do you understand?"]
["'I cannot help myself.", "Will you not make an effort to understand?"]
["Their clear high-pitched voices proclaimed contempt for their surroundings, and left no doubt of their nationality.", "One of them addressed a bewildered porter in cheerful song: 'Are you right there, Michael?", "are you right?"]
["Nor I won't split the difference and go second either, if that's what you're going to propose to me.", "Is it spend what would keep the family of a poor man in bread and tea for a week, for the sake of easing my back with a cushion?"]
["Father Lavelle, this is a friend of mine that I've known ever since he was born, and I haven't laid eyes on him these six years or more.", "You're going West, Mr. Conneally?"]
["Where else would you be going?"]
["Seemingly it's a Protestant minister you've grown into.", "Well now, who'd have thought it?"]
["Well, God is good, and I suppose it's to do the fighting for the rest of us that He makes the likes of Captain Quinn.", "Did you hear that they wanted to make him a member of Parliament?"]
["I never heard of such a thing, and all the grand notions your head was full of!", "Why didn't you come my way?"]
["There's plenty of good convents up and down through the country--more than ever you'll know of, being the black Protestant you are.", "And the ones that ruined your business--supposing they did ruin it, and I've only your word for that--what right have you to be blaming them?"]
["They fetched the people down off the mountains and put them on it.", "Wasn't that a good thing, now?"]
["'So you thought Ireland would be lost altogether unless you wrote articles for Miss Goold in the _Croppy?_ It's no small opinion you have of yourself, Hyacinth Conneally.", "And you thought you'd save your soul by going to preach the Gospel to the English people?"]
["'Of course it wasn't.", "What was I thinking of to forget the young lady that was in it?"]
["By the looks of her she's better than you deserve.", "I suppose it was to get money you went to England, so as to buy her pretty dresses and a beautiful house to live in?"]
["'I knew we'd never be rich.'", "'Well, then, couldn't you as well have been poor in Ireland?"]
["But you made a mistake, whatever you did it for, going off on that English mission.", "Is it a mission you call it when you're a Protestant?"]
["It's hungry I am to get back--just sick with hunger and the great desire that is on me to be back again in Ireland.'", "'Well, what's to hinder you?"]
["'If you could!", "What's the use of talking?", "Isn't your wife's father a Canon?", "And wouldn't that professor in the college that you used to tell me of do something for you?"]

["This accomplished to his satisfaction, he lighted it, crammed some wood into the little air-tight stove, and tilted his chair back against the log wall.", "Well, son, what is it?"]
["What's what?"]
["\"What's on yo' mind?"]
["I've been wishing it would snow for a week.\"", "Snow fer a week?"]
["Wishing for a week.\"", "Well, now it's come, what yo' goin' to do with it?"]
["\"Well, if Dutch Henry an' Black Jack seen him,\" agreed Waseche with conviction, \"he's there.", "But, what in time do yo' want of him?"]
["\"I'll tell you more about that after I've had a try at him,\" grinned the boy.", "Who's going along?"]
["When my laig went bad on me an' I had to go outside, you hit out an' put in the time with the Mounted, then last winteh, 'stead of taking it easy, you hit out fo' Minnesota an' handed that timbeh thievin' bunch what was comin' to 'em.\"", "Well, it paid, didn't it?"]
["\"There's gold--and copper,\" defended the boy.", "Did Dutch Henry an' Black Jack Demeree tell yo' that, too?"]
["Waseche snorted contemptuously, \"Read it in a book!", "Look a heah, son, it don't stand to reason that if anyone know'd they was gold an' coppeh up theah they'd be foolin' away theah time writin' books about it, does it?"]
["Connie's heart raced wildly as he stared at the magnificent animal.", "It seemed incredible that the brute had caught his scent against the wind, and yet, if not, why had he halted so suddenly?", "And why did he stand there sniffing the air?"]
["Every detail of coat, of muzzle, of eyes, of ears, or of legs bespoke the wolf breed--but there were other details--and the heart of the boy leaped as he noted them.", "I wonder what his heart is?"]
["Is it wolf, or dog, or part wolf and a part dog?"]
["CHAPTER II 'MERICAN JOE When Connie regained his feet Spur Mountain was silent as the tomb, and for several moments he stood motionless gazing at the tawny shape that lay still at the end of the stained trail, and at the patch of scrub from which the shape had emerged.", "What was in that dark patch of brush?", "Why had the wolves burst from it in terror?", "Why had the great leader stayed until the snapping of the limb had frightened him away?", "And what had happened to the wolf that lay dead in the snow?"]
["\"Maybe his heart's all wolf,\" he muttered thoughtfully, as he stared at the long slash that extended from the bottom of the flank upward almost to the backbone--a slash as clean as if executed with a sharp knife, and through which the animal's entrails had protruded and his life blood had gushed to discolour the snow.", "What did he do it for?"]
["His first inclination was to leave that place--to return to his camp and harness his dogs and hit the back trail for Ten Bow--then, tomorrow--Even with the thought his jaw stiffened: \"If I do it'll be because I'm afraid,\" he sneered.", "\"What would my dad have done?", "What would Waseche do?", "Or Dan McKeever?", "Or any of the boys?"]
["He seemed to be trying to speak.", "Talk English?"]
["The other nodded: \"Yes--_kloshe wawa_--me spik good.\"", "What's your name--_kahta mika nem_?"]
["The Indian thumped the brute on the ribs and pointed to the boy.", "Is he yours?"]
["\"Where did you get him?"]
["While 'Merican Joe ate the boy cooked up some fish for Leloo, who accepted it from his hand and then settled himself beside him upon the blanket.", "\"Where did you come from?", "And where are you are going?"]
["Yes--I'm lucky I'm hav' my blankets an' kettle on de front of de sled--de ice no ketch.", "But where did you get the dog--or wolf--or whatever Leloo is?"]
["Beyond the big mountains?"]
["Beyond the big river--the Mackenzie?"]
["So I quit try an' lef' heem dere.\"", "Was it a white man?"]
["De wolf an' de dog is mix', lak de color een de hair.", "You savvy?"]
["He work all day lak de dog--an' all night mebbe-so he ron wit' de wolf-pack.\"", "You say you've been over east of the Mackenzie; is there gold over there?"]
["I'm going over there.", "W'en you go?"]
["I go 'long.\"", "\"Do you think there's a good chance to prospect over there?"]
["Eef you got nuff stake for tradin' outfit you mak' de beeg money--you ain' care eef de gol' aint' dere.\"", "You meaning trading with the Indians--free trading?"]
["We can take along some traps, though, and if there isn't any gold--we'll take out some fur.", "And, you'll sure go with me?"]
["It daylight--le's go.", "But, how about the Kuskokwim?"]
["The Indian reached out his hand, and Connie shook it--and thus was the bargain struck.", "Will you sell Leloo?"]
["The Indian shook his head: \"No!\"", "Five hundred dollars?"]
["What I hire you-all for is to get results.", "What do I care whether you use a double-jointed conniption valve, or a reverse English injector on the donkey engine, so you get the water into them sluices?", "Or what do I care whether the bookkeeper keeps all the accounts separate, or adds gum-boots, an' cyanide, an' sandpaper, an' wages all up in one colyumn?", "Or whether the chemist uses peroxide of magentum, or sweet spirits of rawhide, so he gits the gold?"]
["Waseche glared as the miners withdrew, and a young man of twenty-one or-two stepped into the room.", "Waseche continued to glare as the newcomer addressed him: \"Is this Mr. Antrim?"]
["The newcomer shifted his weight to the other foot.", "Sir?"]
["\"Percival Lafollette,\" repeated Waseche, gravely rolling the name upon his tongue.", "'Was you in the original Floradora Sextette?", "Why, no, sir----\" \"No what?"]
["\"So they was,\" agreed Waseche, solemnly.", "Did you bring the mail over?"]
["You didn't come through from Fairbanks in them things?\"", "Yes, Mr. Demeree----\" \"You mean Black Jack?"]
["The young man opened his lips, but somehow the words would not come, and Waseche interrupted him.", "By the way, did you tell anyone your name around here?"]
["\"I'll watch him,\" smiled the boy.", "And, Waseche, where do you think 'Merican Joe came from?"]
["We've got it all worked out.\"", "\"Oh, jest like that, eh?"]
["And the fun we'd have!\"", "\"Ain't they country enough to see here in Alaska?"]
["Who ever heard of anyone goin' 'leven hundred miles into nowheres for to have fun?"]
["He eats 'em alive, Roarin' does.", "What--pancakes?"]
["I figured they was somethin' to him when I first seen him.", "If they wasn't, how did he get up here in the middle of Alaska an' winter comin' on--an' nothin' between him an' freezin' but them hen-skin clothes?"]
["Ignoring the protest of 'Merican Joe, Connie thrust his head in at the doorway.", "What's the matter with you?"]
["Are you crazy?"]
["Who're you?"]
["Involuntarily, Connie's glance swept the supplies piled along the walls and upon the shelves, and estimated a four-man outfit.", "How many of you are there?"]
["And why haven't you got a fire?"]
["I'm crippled--sunk an ax in my foot a couple days back.\"", "Where is your partner?"]
["He noticed the snow clinging to Connie's garments.", "Is it snowin'?"]
["I bet he's lost.", "Go find him, can't you?"]
["And Connie stepped closer.", "\"Look here, who do you think you're talking to?"]
["Connie turned on his heel and started for the door.", "Hey, where you goin'?"]
["Hustle around now an' cook me up a meal of vittles.", "Where's your firewood?"]
["Go out an' cut it, same as we do.", "Don't you keep any ahead, nor any kindlings?"]
["Connie's glance sought the room.", "Where's the ax?"]
["\"Pretty bad gash,\" opined Connie.", "How did it happen?"]
["You've got to learn a lot, haven't you?", "\"What d'you mean--learn?"]
["exclaimed 'Merican Joe.", "How long you be'n here?"]
["What's the matter with that?"]
["Connie glared at the man for a moment, and burst out laughing.", "Did your partner have any dogs with him?"]
["\"Git me out of here!", "Ain't you never comin'?"]
["\"Come on out,\" called Connie.", "What's the matter with you?"]
["How kin I?"]
["Relieved of their burden it was but the work of a few moments to gain the floor of the valley and hasten to the form wedged tightly between two upstanding boulders, where they were greeted by the voice of the man raised in whining complaint.", "Are you hurt?"]
["\"Naw, I ain't hurt but can't you pick out no smoother trail?"]
["Indeed, his first words were in the nature of an indirect accusation of theft.", "Whur's my marten?", "\"What marten?"]
["Daylight was breaking and Connie, bottling his wrath behind tight-pressed lips, rose abruptly, and prepared to depart.", "Whur you goin'?"]
["\"You lay around here soakin' up heat all night; looks like you could anyways cut a little wood an' help worsh these dishes!", "An', say, don't you want to buy some moose meat?"]
["Two hours later, as they sat in their cozy tent, pitched five miles down the river, and devoured their breakfast, Connie grinned at his companion.", "Big difference in men--even in _chechakos_, ain't there, Joe?"]
["We're going to mush!", "Do you hear?"]
["Victor and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had heard of the threats of vengeance, but knowing Ren\u00e9, they had smiled.", "Was not Ren\u00e9 a great boaster?"]
["\"Pay!", "Who talks of pay?"]
["What then?"]
["Victor glanced up in surprise.", "Why?"]
["They think I have broken their law.", "Have you?"]
["What if I have?"]
["\"What was I to do?"]
["You thought you would be safe here because the police, knowing of your loud-bawled threats against me, would think we were mortal enemies.", "You knew of that--of my threats?"]
["\"Of course I knew.", "But what are threats between brothers?"]
["She pointed toward the door.", "\"But--what is it--out there?"]
["It is a time of great evil.", "Did you not see the plague flag?"]
["\"Oh, no one told me!", "Who is there to tell?"]
["What else could it be?\"", "How long has he been sick?"]
["\"Did he have any fits?", "Did he vomit?"]
["He'll be well as ever in three or four days.", "Are you sure?"]
["How can you tell?"]
["interrupted Connie.", "\"Was it canned milk?"]
["exclaimed the boy, fidgeting uncomfortably.", "\"What I want is the dope on this Rainy--how did he come to swipe the kid's milk?", "And where is he heading for?"]
["\"We have one day's grub, for a three-day's trail if we hit straight for Fort Norman,\" he announced.", "\"Why then do we follow this man's trail?"]
["Why do you always take upon yourself the troubles of others?\"", "Where would _you_ have been if I didn't?"]
["\"And where would the trapper have been and that woman and little baby?"]
["Take it at this very post.", "We will suppose that the beaver are becoming scarce around here; what do we do?"]
["And they obey us--why?"]
["So the killing goes merrily on where the free traders are--and soon all the fur-bearing animals are exterminated from that section.", "What does the free trader care?"]
["Admit that his goods did measure up to our standard.", "What would he have to charge for them?"]
["How much debt do they get?"]
["It varies from one hundred to five or six hundred, and in exceptional cases even to a thousand skins.\"", "What do you mean by a skin?"]
["It is then you will see why it is that the free trader has small chance of doing business at a profit north of sixty.\"", "But, why wouldn't it be just as easy to figure it in dollars?"]
["Take this post, for instance.", "Suppose we were compelled to ship silver dollars back and forth between here and Edmonton?"]
["Six hundred pounds would mean, on scows, six pieces--and mighty valuable pieces too, to be loaded and unloaded a dozen times, carried over portages, shot through dangerous rapids, carried up and down slippery river banks and across slippery planks to the scows.", "Suppose one of these pieces were dropped overboard by one of the none too careful half-breed rivermen?"]
["Or, suppose the riverman very conveniently dropped the piece into the water where he could recover it again?"]
["One hundred pounds, where freight costs sixteen cents a pound to move, is much cheaper to move than six hundred pounds.\"", "Yes,\" agreed Connie, \"but how about using paper money?"]
["And by the time we make two trips and build a cabin besides, we won't have much time left for trapping.\"", "Where you headin' for?"]

["As both were caught by the fore leg, a loop of copper wire was slipped about their hind legs and the animals thus stretched out and dispatched in the same manner as the first.", "What are we going to do when we finish up this trap line?"]

["M. Dagobert,\" said Loony in a doleful voice, \"I beg pardon for bringing up the gentleman without leave; but, alas, my head is turned, because of the misfortune that happened to Madame Augustine.", "What misfortune?"]
["Will you go?"]
["said Blanche, interposing between the soldier and his prey.", "What has happened to Madame Augustine?"]
["Rose hastily approached the soldier, and said to him: \"Is it true--is it really true that poor Madame Augustine has been attacked with the cholera?\"", "No--I do not know--I cannot tell,\" replied the soldier, hesitating; \"besides, what is it to you?"]
["Surprised at these words, the girls stood motionless and irresolute.", "If our governess is not here, where is she, then?"]
["You have news of the marshal!", "Pray, what is this news?"]
["First of all,\" said the soldier, after a moment's silence, \"a true man never speaks of the services he has rendered, and you come back three times to the subject.", "But Dagobert,\" whispered Rose, \"if he brings news of our father?"]
["I cunning?"]
["I have already had the honor of informing you of the object of my visit, my dear sir.", "To bring news of Marshal Simon?"]
["So saying, Rodin again bowed very low, and, concealing his rage and vexation, left the room before Dagobert, who made a sign to the two sisters, and then followed, closing the door after him.", "What news of our father, Dagobert?"]
["\"Well, that old conjurer knows that the marshal set out in good spirits, and he seems acquainted with M. Robert.", "How could he be informed of all this?"]
["But what news of our father?"]
["Possibly so; but I am not sorry for it.", "And why?"]
["It was about ten o'clock in the morning.", "\"Well, gentlemen,\" said one of those newly arrived, \"how are we getting on?"]
["Then there is some hope of seeing it decrease.", "And have any of the gentlemen, whose places we come to take, been attacked by the disease?"]
["I have still the horrible scene before my eyes.\"", "A sudden attack of cholera?"]
["What then did he die of?"]
["And this was--\" \"Hydrophobia.", "Did he become mad?", "How did it happen, then?"]
["'Twas indeed frightful.", "And is Morok dead?"]
["And indeed Rose and Blanche soon entered the antechamber, with a timid, anxious air, though a sort of feverish excitement was visible in their looks.", "Is not this, sir,\" replied Rose, \"the infirmary of the Rue du Mont Blanc?"]
["He is asking what is the matter.", "What will he do?"]
["Each of them exclaimed, at sight of the fearful change in her sister's features.", "Are you also ill, sister?"]
["Like you, sister.", "And do you feel a cold shudder?"]
["Let it only be together!", "And our poor father?", "And Dagobert?"]
["In spite of his firmness of soul, the missionary could not help shuddering as he reflected on the fate of the orphans, the death of Jacques Rennepont, and the fearful devices by which M. Hardy, retired to the cloistered solitude of St. Herein, had become a member of the Society of Jesus almost in dying.", "The missionary said to himself, that already four members of the Rennepont family--his family--had been successively struck down by some dreadful fate; and he asked himself with alarm, how it was that the detestable interests of the Society of Loyola should be served by a providential fatality?"]
["Then, more and more bewildered they both gazed fixedly at the angelic countenance of Gabriel.", "Sister,\" said Rose, in a faint voice, \"do you see the archangel--as in our dreams, in Germany?"]
["Until now, stupefied with amazement and sorrow, almost suffocated with sobs, Gabriel had not been able to utter a word.", "But at these words of the orphans, he exclaimed: \"Dear children, why doubt of your mother's salvation?"]
["never did a purer soul ascend to its Creator.", "Your mother?"]
["believe me; God has blessed her.\"", "Do you hear, sister?"]
["Think of your father.\"", "Our father?"]
["After moving his lantern up and down, and all about, the gravedigger showed Samuel, at the foot of a tall yew-tree, with long black branches, a little mound of newly-raised earth, and said: \"It is here.\"", "You are sure of it?"]
["said the Jew, with a deep sigh.", "Now that you know the place, what do you want more?"]
["Well, then, Adrienne,\" resumed Mother Bunch, \"I think it would be a charming picture, for you are dressed, as usual with perfect taste.", "\"But am I not better dressed than on other days, my dear poetess?"]
["\"Only,\" said the hunchback, hesitating.", "Only?"]
["You see, I expect a visit from my dear aunt.\"", "The Princess de Saint-Dizier?"]
["That wicked lady, who did you so much evil?"]
["She has asked for an interview, and I shall be delighted to receive her.\"", "Delighted?"]
["Mother Bunch was about to rise and quit the room; but Adrienne held her back, and said to her, taking her hand with an air of serious tenderness: \"Stay, my dear friend, I entreat you.\"", "Do you wish it?"]
["\"It can at least answer, madame,\" replied Mother Bunch, in her calm voice.", "I wish to see you alone, niece--is that clear?"]
["It puts me at my ease, as you say.\"", "Does it indeed, madame?"]
["Recovering from her first amazement, Adrienne replied, with a calm smile, which checked the joy of the princess: \"Well, I confess frankly, madame, that you have surprised me; I expected from you one of those black pieces of malignity, one of those well-laid plots, in which you are known to excel, and I did not think you would make all this fuss about such a trifle.\"", "\"To be ruined--completely ruined,\" cried the princess, \"and that by to morrow--you that have been so prodigal, will see your house, furniture, horses, jewels, even the ridiculous dresses of which you are so vain, all taken from you--do you call that a trifle?"]
["Ah, my dear aunt!", "resumed Adrienne, in a tone of self-reproach; \"have I presumed too much on the goodness of your heart?", "Have you not even sympathy for vipers?", "For whom, then, have you any?"]
["You remember the handsome lad, that we found in your apartment.", "You cannot be so faithless, as already to have forgotten his name?"]
["At these unexpected and dreadful words, Adrienne, Djalma, and Mother Bunch, though under the influence of different kinds of resentment, remained for a moment mute with surprise; and the princess, judging it no longer necessary to repress her infernal joy and triumphant hatred, exclaimed, as she rose from her seat, with flushed cheek, and flashing eyes, \"Yes, I defy you to contradict me.", "Were we not forced to confine you, on the plea of madness?"]
["For a second, the young lady was even more afflicted than terrified at the threatening and formidable expression of the young Indian's countenance.", "Can stupid indignity exasperate him to this degree?"]
["Does he suspect me; then?"]
["For, in those two lovers, the finest qualities of sense and soul seemed exactly to balance each other, and heaven had bestowed on them the rarest beauty of form, and the most adorable excellence of heart, as if to legitimatize the irresistible attraction which drew and bound them together.", "What, then, was to be the term of this painful trial, which Adrienne had imposed on Djalma and on herself?"]
["Like you, I believe there is no dignity but in freedom.", "But you have said, that, for this great and holy love, you demand a religious consecration; and if you reject vows, that you cannot make without folly and perjury, are there then others, which your reason and your heart approve?--Who will pronounce the required blessing?"]
["No, no; such laws are not made either for you or me.", "Is it not to prove your sacred respect for our love, to wish to raise it above the shameful servitude that would degrade it?"]
["Because our love must be consecrated by the benediction of heaven.", "Are we not free?"]
["how admirable and marvellous are these mysterious evolutions of the mind; how incomprehensible is the chain of human thought, which, starting from an absurd jingle of words, arrives at a splendid or luminous idea!", "Is it weakness?", "or is it strength?"]
["The more I reflect upon it, the more feasible it appears.", "Only how to get at that wretch, Saint-Colombe?", "Well, there is Jacques Dumoulin, and the other--where to find her?"]
["Talk of the acorn that becomes an oak, the seed that grows up to the corn--the seed takes months, the acorn centuries, to unfold its splendors--but here is a little word in eight letters, necklace and this word, falling into my brain but a few minutes ago, has grown and grown till it has become larger than any oak.", "And what matters it, after all, to the moral order I am reserved to guide, whether these people live or die?", "What do such lives weigh in the balance of the great destinies of the world?"]
["The chapel being, as you know, at a distance from the house, they were able to effect an entry without disturbing us.", "Who can have carried away this body?"]
["Who could have any interest in doing so?"]
["cried Rodin, exasperated by these Italian exaggerations.", "What is the object?"]
["Faringhea had refused the gold, and appeared to accept the friendship of the son of Kadja-sing.", "Besides, what motives could Djalma have to suspect the slave, now become his friend?"]
["\"But unhappy love, miserable love, betrayed love--weeps tears of blood,\" replied Faringhea, with painful dejection.", "Of what love dost thou speak?"]
["\"I speak of my love,\" answered the half-caste, with a gloomy air.", "Of your love?"]
["Even cowards may point at one with scorn--for, in this country, the sight of the man deceived in what is dearest to his soul, the very life blood of his life, only makes people shrug their shoulders and laugh.", "But are you certain of this treachery?"]
["leave the wretch to his despair!\"", "Do you think me capable of that?"]
["This evening--she made an appointment--with a man that she prefers to me.", "Who told you so?"]
["And suppose the man deceived you--or deceives himself?"]
["What proofs?"]
["Judge for yourself, have courage, and your cruel indecision will be at an end.'\"", "And what did you answer?"]
["My head wandered as it does now and I came to you for advice.\"", "Then, making a gesture of despair, he proceeded with a savage laugh: \"Advice?"]
["But you must not go alone.", "What do you mean, my lord?"]
["Who will accompany me?"]
["You, my lord?"]
["forgive me!\"", "For what should I forgive you?"]
["Faringhea!", "he exclaimed; \"where am I?", "where are you?"]
["And I have killed her.", "Now that she is dead, what is her treachery to me?"]
["Alas!", "I could not hope to gain the preference,\" added he, with a touching mixture of resignation and remorse; \"I, poor, untaught youth--how could I merit her love?"]
["What was her crime?", "Did she not meet me freely?", "Did she not open to me her dwelling?"]
["\"That remained with me--no one could take from me that treasure of the past--that ought to have consoled me.", "But why think of it?"]
["Blood for blood; my life for hers.", "How happens it that my steel did not turn aside?"]
["Cruelly hurt and offended, she was about to reproach him with his conduct, when she perceived the dagger, which he had thrown down upon the ermine carpet.", "At sight of this weapon, and the expression of fear and stupor which petrified the features of Djalma, who remained kneeling, motionless, with his body thrown back, hands stretched out, his eyes fixed and wildly staring Adrienne, no longer dreading an amorous surprise, was seized with an indescribable terror, and, instead of flying from the prince, advanced several steps towards him, and said, in an agitated voice, whilst she pointed to the kandjiar, \"My friend, why are you here?", "what ails you?"]
["repeated the young lady, in amazement.", "\"It was not thou, really not thou, whom I killed?"]
["Oh!", "what does he say?"]
["had it been you, the steel would have turned back upon myself.\"", "You have killed some one?"]
["\"Why?"]
["And the oriental wept for joy.", "\"A dream?"]
["exclaimed Adrienne, and her teeth chattered convulsively.", "What poison?"]
["\"To die?"]
["wherefore?"]
["The young lady was the first to break this mournful silence, and said in a tone which she tried to make calm and steady, \"Well!", "what is there extraordinary in this?"]
["That also is natural enough.", "Why look at me thus?"]
["His knees shook under him, and he felt down upon the bed, near which he was standing.", "Already?"]
["\"Death already?"]
["Our cruel enemies shall not triumph!\"", "What do you say?"]
["Only this morning, I gave to the apostolic man, that was to bless our union, in thy name and mine, a royal gift--a gift, that will bring joy and peace to the heart of many an unfortunate creature.", "Then what have we to regret, my beloved?"]
["I must confess,\" added Father d'Aigrigny, with a jealous and hateful smile, \"that Rodin is a man of rare dissimulation, patience, energy, obstinacy and intelligence.", "Who would have told a few months ago, when he wrote under my orders, a discreet and humble socius, that he had already conceived the most audacious ambition, and dared to lift his eyes to the Holy See itself?", "that, thanks to intrigues and corruption, pursued with wondrous ability, these views were not so unreasonable?"]
["sneered Father d'Aigrigny, with a smile of irony and triumph, \"you wish to be a second Sixtus V., do you?"]
["Yes, sir--because I am a priest.", "So that, because he is a priest, a wretch like you may commit any crime, any baseness, under shelter of his black gown?"]
["Yet he answered, in a tone that was still calm: \"For the last time, sir, I repeat to you, that my profession forbids me to fight.\"", "Then you refuse?"]
["I refuse.", "Positively?"]
["And then this Marshal Simon might have had some claim on his daughter's inheritance.", "And, between ourselves, my dear father, what was I to do?"]
["\"Nothing,\" said Faringhea, still absorbed in painful thought.", "Nothing?"]
["What, then, was the use of bringing it so far?"]
["Very early.", "Before leaving home, he will go to say prayers in the chapel?"]
["You sleep near him?"]
["Then, after a moment's silence, he looked full in Caboccini's face, and added: \"I say this, that you may report my words to Cardinal Malipieri, and beg him to mention them to--\" Faringhea stopped short.", "To whom should the cardinal mention your words?"]
["Upon his venerable cheeks were the traces of recent tears, which he strove to dry with his trembling hands, as he opened the door to Rodin.", "Who are you, gentlemen?"]
["My lips and throat are dried up, like parchment baked at the fire.\"", "\"Will you not take something, my dear, good father?"]
["Are closed.", "And the iron casket?"]
["\"To-day, we must go higher,\" answered Samuel, as he began slowly to ascend the stairs.", "\"Where to?"]
["\"To the Hall of Mourning,\" replied the Jew, and he continued to ascend.", "What is the Hall of Mourning?"]
["\"A place of tears and death,\" answered the Israelite; and he kept on ascending through the darkness, for the little lamp threw but a faint light around.", "But,\" said Rodin, more and more astonished, and stopping short on the stairs, \"why go to this place?", "\"The money is there,\" answered Samuel, and he went on, \"Oh?"]
["He seemed to be in deep thought.", "Will we soon be there?"]
["Addressing Rodin, who was wiping his forehead with his dirty handkerchief, and looking round him with surprise, but not fear, Samuel said to him: \"The will of the testator, however strange it may appear, is sacred with me, and must be accomplished in all things.\"", "Certainly,\" said Rodin; \"but what are we to do here?"]
["To save time,\" resumed Samuel, \"I will, previous to the arrival of the magistrate, go through the inventory of the securities contained in this casket, which I withdrew yesterday from the custody of the Bank of France.", "The securities are there?"]
["A mute witness of this scene, Samuel smiled also with an air of triumph, as he closed the casket by means of the spring known only to himself.", "That metallic sound recalled Rodin from the heights of his mad ambition to the realities of life, and he said to Samuel in a sharp voice: \"You have heard?"]
["the eternal justice of heaven will not allow it.\"", "\"On murder?"]
["Seized with indignation and horror, Samuel threw himself before him, and, pressing with all his might on a knob in the lid of the casket--a knob which yielded to the pressure--he exclaimed: \"Since your infernal soul is incapable of remorse, it may perhaps be shaken by disappointed avarice.\"", "What does he say?"]
["What is he doing?"]
["No doubt, they have tried to poison me.", "But when?"]
["Sometimes, in our winter evenings, you have been able to appreciate the delicate and charming mind of the gentle 'Mother Bunch,' the rare poetical imagination of Agricola, the tenderness of his mother, the good sense of his father, the exquisite natural grace of Angela.", "Tell me, my friend, was it possible to unite more elements of domestic happiness?"]
["And yet, when I picture to myself the realization of the magnificent views of--my ancestor--an admirable Utopia, only possible with immense resources--and which Mdlle.", "What remains now of all these splendid projects?"]
["But there were also others whom I met that day for the last time--Brigadier-General Neil Findlay, commanding the artillery, who had been in the same room with me at the \"Shop,\" and Lieut.-Colonel Adrian Grant-Duff of the Black Watch, excusing his presence in the firing-line on the plea that he \"really _must_ see how his lads worked through the woodlands\"; both had made the supreme sacrifice in France before the leaves were off the trees.", "How many are alive and unmaimed to-day of those fighting men of all ranks who buzzed about so cheerily amid the heather and the pine trees that afternoon, and who melted away so silently out of Aldershot a very few days later?"]

["Crossed over on her once from Cork to Milford.", "\"Ye did, yer honour--sorr, I mane?"]
["It's mostly onaisy in me inside I am, sorr, on the say, but it was beautiful calm an'----\" \"Yes, yes; but look here--Where was it you left your regiment?\"", "\"Is it me, sorr?", "Me lave me rigimint, sorr?", "Me lave me rigimint?"]

["It is, however, bare justice to him to acknowledge that, after I had served his purpose and when he came to send me back to England from Boulogne before he resumed his inspection of troops and trenches, he was grandmotherly in his solicitude that I should meet with no misadventure.", "\"Have you got your yellow form all right, sir?"]
["For instance: He burst tumultuously into my room one morning flourishing a paper.", "Have you seen this, sir?"]
["\"But do you know what it is, sir?"]
["I was aghast.", "Shall I go and see the Director-General, A.M.S., about it, sir?"]
["This was disconcerting, seeing that I had done nothing.", "\"Oh, but, sir,\" sounding that note of submissive expostulation which the tactful staff-officer contrives to introduce when he feels himself obliged reluctantly to express disapproval of superior military authority, \"oughtn't we to do something?"]

["We may fail in the end then, but we shall have followed the only possible path to success.", "How shall we choose our aim?"]
["But what shall our minor aim be, or shall we be content to drift without any at all?"]
["They think when love comes it will do everything, and it is true that it will do wonders.", "But suppose a girl remembers that if she is well she can make her family happier then if she is always ailing,--suppose she remembers how much good housekeeping does to make a home attractive; that if she is musical her singing will calm the troubled waters, while if she is not her practicing will be a burden; that there are some studies which bear directly on life and some others which will be of infinite use to a mother in training her children,--is she not more likely to have a happy home than if her aim had been less definite?", "But what of the girls who choose this aim and who never have a home?"]
["Now that girls wish to be well, it is worth while to consider two questions.", "First, why is health so important?", "Unless the answer to this question is clear, how can any one be ready to sacrifice health to any higher duty?"]

["You are so cold!", "Do you know that the moment you begin to breathe it you begin to grow warm from the increased action of the blood?"]

["A PRACTICAL EDUCATION.", "What is a practical education for a girl?"]
["The question and answer are trite.", "What will best fit a girl for life?"]
["The first thing we all need is to have our wills so trained that when we see the right, we may instantly do it, and after that we need to be taught to see clearly what is right.", "But as character may be formed in many ways why not form it by teaching practical things?", "What, then, does a girl most need to learn?"]
["The practical advantage of most of her studies in school depends on whether or no they lead to this result.", "How many girls ever use chemistry, or physics, or geology, or zo\u00f6logy in any practical way?"]
["Who can learn enough history in school to be equipped even to teach history?"]
["I do believe in a very broad education for girls; but if I had to choose between a broad education which had crammed a girl with knowledge, yet left her without a love for good reading, and a very narrow one which had awakened that thirst, I should choose the second.", "But why do I call this a practical education?"]
["The tide of opinion is against me here.", "A boy must know arithmetic of course, or how can he fulfill his destiny and make money?"]
["At last he remembered that she ought to have a teacher in English, and a lady was engaged to teach grammar and literature and history.", "And arithmetic?"]

["If thirteen yards of ribbon cost $3.25, how much will one yard cost?"]
["Upon my word, I've got the answer--25!", "Twenty-five what?"]
["Wouldn't that be rather high for ribbon?"]
["This is by no means saying that it is not well for many children to be sent to school, but it is calling attention to a great privilege which some mothers and some children may enjoy.", "What ought a woman to be able to teach her children?"]
["And all this time I have said nothing of any use to be made of education in earning a living.", "Yet is not that just what our education must do if it is to be practical?"]

["Who is to decide whether it is prudent for a girl to spend all she has on a musical education with the hope of making herself independent in the end?"]
["What you need to do is to study some literary masterpiece till you thoroughly appreciate it, and then read it as simply and clearly as possible.\"", "But would anybody come to hear me read?"]
["A woman with artistic tastes will probably do better service in studying ways of making beautiful homes or in lines of decorative work than by striving to paint great pictures.", "Let her paint the pictures if she is moved to do it and has time, and if they turn out to be great pictures that will be well; but until her greatness has been proved, would it not be better for her to depend for her support on the less ambitious departments of her art, especially as a beautifully planned home gives a higher artistic pleasure than second-rate painting?"]
["But some can never be disciplinarians, however determined their character may be, principally, I think, because the true student must usually be occupied with a train of thought which cannot be interrupted from moment to moment to detect the petty tricks of insubordinate pupils.", "So if you mean to be a teacher, think first whether you have quick observation; then, are you firm, and are you willing to give your whole heart to your work?"]
["When they are thoroughly understood, some light may be thrown on our own brain and senses.", "Who but the rich can have leisure for such important experiments?"]
["In both these cases the ladies were as much bound by their self-imposed tasks as if they had been earning their living, and their characters received almost as great benefit; but it would not have been well that they should be paid for their work.", "Why should they compete with those who needed the money?"]
["Even rarer than to write English well.", "If a woman is aware that she has grace in expressing herself, and a delicate perception of the meaning of words, and the power to comprehend the thought of a writer, then can she do better with time and money than to perfect her knowledge of a language so that she can make a good translation of some fine book which would otherwise be neglected?"]
["Their danger is superficiality through trying to do too many things.", "How can we be broad without being superficial?"]
["For the fruit of culture is to be and not to do; and what we are, intellectually at least, depends even more on the breadth of knowledge which helps us to balance conflicting judgments than on special knowledge which gives us accurate judgment in details.", "Even in the moral world, are not the finest characters those in whom many virtues are balanced rather than those in which one virtue is distorted by being allowed exclusive sway?"]
["They could not act freely and spontaneously, and they could not even admire such action in others.", "How shall we train our girls so that they may have just judgments and yet not make them so introspective that the bloom shall be brushed off the beauty of every action?"]
["The sisters looked scornful at this.", "How could anybody see anything worth seeing with an excursion party?"]
["Now, hard workers obviously cannot study French and German and Italian and music and art, at least all at once, and if they try and so crowd out all their little leisure, they miss the better culture which is within their reach.", "What must you who are hard workers take time to do?"]
["Especially try to judge fairly in every-day matters.", "Culture, demands balance of mind; but is not that as good when it comes from thought as from study?"]

["The general belief about hysteria is that it is caused by the culpable weakness of a selfish nature, and that is often true.", "Now what are _fine_ feelings?"]
["But men are as generous and loving as women, so, after all, we do have something a little different from this in our minds when we speak of the emotional nature of women.", "Do we not mean that a woman is unreasonable?"]
["A girl cannot be too careful to guard against such an emotion.", "And then, why should a woman cease to love a man simply because she is disappointed to find that he does not love her?"]
["One great reason that emotional women attract men is because they can make a hero out of such unheroic stuff.", "And why should we try always to see the exact reality as if that were nearer the truth than the same reality transfigured by ideal light?"]
["Ardent feelings well controlled,--that is our ideal; but how few women of strong feelings do control them well, and how few who have perfect self-control have very strong feelings!", "Which shall we choose, the strong feelings or the self-control?"]
["Others may choose to love or hate us for the temperament we are not responsible for, but what can we do for ourselves?"]
["How are they to make themselves feel without becoming hypocrites?"]
["I will therefore speak particularly of some of our failings which lean to virtue's side.", "What is it, for instance, to be a sensitive woman?"]
["But suppose they also tremble at ugliness, and shrink from pain?"]
["She fears a slight was intended, and rather than submit to it, deliberately hurts some one who she knows may be innocent.", "Would it not be better to believe that the person who has hurt her is innocent, and submit to the slight even if it was intended?", "What harm can it do her to think a guilty person innocent?", "And what harm can a slight do her?"]
["They are strong partisans, and are determined to believe those they love always in the right.", "That seems like an amiable failing; but is it?", "Do we wish even our enemy to be wronged to save our friend?"]
["Our faith in them helps them to rise, but not our pretense that they are right when they are wrong.", "After all, however, who is perfectly balanced?"]
["And there are other women so ardent and generous and loving that they seem to lend wings to everybody they meet, who are yet crushed and ruined themselves by the excess of their grief not only for their own sorrows, but for those of the whole world, until by and by they drag their dearest and most sympathetic friends down into the same abyss of woe.", "How shall we keep the true balance?"]

["An ardent, active girl may easily become so interested in her charities and her studies that she may make a genuine plea that she is too busy for parties and calls; but perhaps she ought not to give up society duties until higher duties actually open before her.", "Is it not possible that society has some intrinsic worth, or that at all events it might have worth, if earnest people did their part?"]
["It would, I think, be a good plan for every girl who wishes to give up society to consider this picture well.", "If society were always like this, would you wish to give it up?", "If it is not like this, may it not be possible for you to help to make it so?", "Is there any better work laid ready to your hand?"]

["All these attractions may be cultivated without nourishing the noxious weed of vanity, which many mothers dread so much.", "And is it not natural that a man who can appreciate a good and intelligent woman should find her still more winning if she has a sweet, fresh face and a trim dress?"]
["Their chances of marriage might not be increased by it, but if worst came to worst, it would make them most incomparable old maids.\"", "If a woman is not married in the end, the wider and deeper her education goes, the happier and more useful she is; and yet can we deny that a very wide education is likely to repel rather than attract even highly educated men?"]
["He was asked to make a speech, and after glancing at the five hundred beautiful young girls before him, he turned to the fine faces of the teachers, many of whom were gray-haired, and said:-- \"It is a beautiful thing to be a charming young lady; and the best of it is that you will sometime have a chance to be a charming old lady!\"", "All old ladies are not charming, but a great many of them are; and would not all of us be so if we could follow the prescriptions I have given so liberally for the conduct of life all the way through?", "Suppose we were all sweet-tempered and warm-hearted and truthful, and as neat and pretty as we could be, and bright and intelligent and modest and helpful--do you not think we should be charming even if our eyes were dim and our ears dull, and we walked with a cane?"]

["But a clattering and stamping were heard in the yard, and Aurelia, looking from the window, called Mrs. Dove to see four horses being harnessed to a coach that was standing there.", "Lawk-a-day?"]
["She would beg her to get in when the riders overtook her.", "When would they?"]
["The only ray of comfort was in the face of a stout, comely, rosy maid-servant, who was holding the candle on the threshold, and with one bound the poor traveller dashed past the black hand held out to help her, and rushing up to the girl, caught hold of her, and gasped out, \"Oh!", "What is that?", "Where am I?"]
["She set a chair for the trembling girl, saying, \"You will excuse the having supper here to-night, madam; the south parlour will be ready for you to-morrow.\"", "Is not Mrs. Dove coming?"]
["You are to be here with the young ladies, ma'am.\"", "What young ladies?"]
["\"There!", "You will take no more roll?"]
["I shall die!\"", "What means this, madam?"]
["she managed faintly to utter, falling again into the friendly chair.", "The music?"]
["I did not know it could be heard in your room, but no doubt the windows below are open.\"", "Is Jumbo that black man?"]
["With these words Mrs. Aylward curtsied as if about to retire, Aurelia held out her hand in entreaty.", "Oh, cannot you stay with me?"]
["\"Speak pretty, my dear; speak to the pretty lady.", "Don't ye see how good your sister is?"]
["\"Yes,\" she said.", "And what shall I call you, my dear?"]
["exclaimed Mrs. Wheatfield, laughing, \"they be both of 'em eldest, as one may say.\"", "They are twins, then?"]
["The good gossip must have presumed greatly on the children's want of comprehension if she did not suppose that they understood her at least as well as the young lady to whom her dialect was strange.", "And has she not seen them?"]
["whispered Aurelia.", "You'll be good to them, won't you miss?"]
["The little sister, who had not brought her nurse, was, however, well contented to be lifted to Aurelia's knee, and returned her caresses.", "\"And have you not a name, my dear?"]
["\"Oh, that is pretty.", "And what can your name be, my dear little Fay?"]
["Then only could she take her little writing-case to begin her letter to Betty.", "It would be an expensive luxury to her family, but she knew how it would be longed for; and though she cried a good deal over her writing, she felt as if she ought to make the best of her position, for had not Betty said it was for her father's sake?"]
["THE DARK CHAMBER.", "Or singst thou rather under force Of some Divine command, Commissioned to presage a course Of happier days at hand?"]
["Mrs. Aylward seemed to think her doubts uncalled for, and attributed her hesitation to fear of the dark room.", "Oh, no I am not so childish,\" said the young lady with nervous dignity; \"but would it be proper?"]
["You are very good, sir,\" murmured Aurelia, oppressed by the gloom and the peculiar atmosphere, cool--for the windows were open behind the shutters--but strangely fragrant.", "How does my excellent friend, Major Delavie?"]
["It is a fine place, sir.", "But somewhat lonely for so youthful a lady?"]
["And I believe that she herself made the English words, when she was asked what the nightingales say.\"", "\"May I hear it?"]
["She scarcely expected to be sent for on Sunday evening, but Jumbo came as usual with the invitation, and she was far from sorry to quit a worm-eaten Baxter's _Saints' Rest_ which she had dutifully borrowed from Mrs. Aylward.", "Well, my fair visitor,\" said the voice which had acquired a tone of pleased anticipation, \"what mental repast has your goodness provided?"]
["No, sir, Mr. Greaves does not come to-day.", "Then how did the gentle saint perform her orisons?"]
["I tried to read the service, but I could not get the children to be still, so I had to tell them about Joseph, and I found a beautiful Bible full of pictures, like our Dutch one at home.\"", "\"You found the old Bible?"]
["Aurelia, in high glee, told Mr. Belamour, who encouraged her to describe all her small adventures, and was her oracle in all the difficult questions that Fidelia's childish wisdom was wont to start.", "\"To Wheatfield's farm, did you say?"]
["May I ask you to repeat it again?\"", "\"The texts?"]
["Sorrow not as others that have no hope.'\"", "Did you call them Scripture texts?"]
["\"Nay, they have come to you at last,\" said Aurelia gently.", "You really never knew of them before?"]
["Aurelia carried the invitation to her oracle.", "My cousins are willing to make your acquaintance?"]
["Jumbo shall escort you home in the evening.\"", "Thank you, sir, but must I accept the invitation?"]
["Moreover, the Mistresses Treforth are highly respected, and your father and sister will certainly think it well for you to have female friends.\"", "Do you think those ladies could ever be my friends, sir?"]
["If they were only like you, sir!", "What would they say to that?"]
["I suppose your charges are not included in the invitation?"]
["She cannot reasonably do so.", "And, sir, shall I be permitted to come home in time for you to receive me?"]
["Mrs. Hunter seemed to have heard wonderful rumours about the poor children.", "Has their lady mother seen them?"]
["My sister Chetwynd saw him with his mother at a masquerade, my Lady Belamour flaunting as Venus, and he, when he ought to have been in his bed, dressed in rose-colour and silver, with a bow and arrows, and gauze wings on his shoulders!", "What will that child come to?"]
["You heard how she would take no advice, and replied with impertinence.\"", "Shall you give my Lady a hint?"]
["He went away before supper.\"", "Did he see the young ladies?"]
["Jumbo told me, Molly.", "\"Ain't he a perfect pictur of a man?"]
["\"When I could, I gave them my name and they asked no more.", "Yet what did they tell me of a sealed letter from my brother, addressed to me?"]
["I could imagine what you say of Mistress Phoebe, sir, better than of Mistress Delia.", "Had they any guests to meet you?"]
["Turn, gentle hermit of the dale.--GOLDSMITH.", "My child, will you do me a favour?"]
["\"That I can well believe,\" said Dr. Godfrey.", "Have these agreeable recitations made you acquainted with the new poem on the _Seasons_ by Mr. James Thomson?"]
["\"More of this another time,\" said Mr. Belamour hastily.", "What say the critics respecting this new aspirant?"]
["They knew who he was, for \"Ned Godfrey\" had been a frequent guest at Bowstead in the youth of all parties, and they were annoyed that he had not paid his respects to them.", "Pray, miss, did my eccentric cousin place you in the position of hostess?"]
["THE QUEEN OF BEAUTY.", "O bright _regina_, who made thee so faire, Who made thy colour vermeilie and white?"]
["\"You will not long have known her, my fair friend, without discovering that she is one of the most inscrutable of her sex.", "Do you think, sir, she can mean to take me away?"]
["if you could only live at the Great House, at home, I should be quite happy.\"", "Then you would not willingly abandon the recluse?"]
["And you would be all alone again with Jumbo!", "Oh sir, could you not drive down if all the coach windows were close shut up?"]
["And what would your papa say to having a miserable old hermit inflicted on him?"]
["I could not make my abode in Lady Belamour's house, while in that of my nephew, my natural home, I have a right to drag out what remains of the existence of mine.", "Nay, are you weeping, my sweet child?"]
["Even should Lady Belamour's arbitrary caprice bear you off without another meeting, remember that you have given me many more happy hours than I ever supposed to be in store for me, and have opened doors which shall not be closed again.\"", "You will get some one to recite to you?"]
["Then turning to the two children, she asked their names, and was answered by each distinctly, with the orthodox \"madam\" at the end.", "You are improved, little ones,\" she said: \"Did Cousin Aurelia teach you?"]
["\"She is usually very good, madam,\" said Aurelia, eagerly.", "Is she your favourite?"]
["It is enough for me to see the brats on their good manners now and then.", "You have had other recreations--shall I call them, or cares?"]
["\"I so esteem it, madam,\" said Aurelia, blushing.", "More honour than pleasure, eh?"]
["Say you so?"]
["\"Oh, you are learned.", "Is Mr. Belamour your tutor, pray?"]
["What!", "you have not heard?"]
["Oh, nurse, he is the wisest, cleverest gentleman I ever saw, except my papa.", "\"Do you say do, miss?"]
["I can deepen them by what our unhappy recluse said of you.", "I shall make glad hearts at Carminster by his good opinion, and who knows what preferment may come of it--eh?"]
["\"It is work your Ladyship wished me to execute,\" said Aurelia.", "\"Handsome--yes; but is that all?"]
["She said Mr. Wayland wished to recompense me.", "\"Did he so?"]
["Sir, may I write to your bookseller, Mr. Tonson, and order a book of Mr. James Thomson's _Seasons_ to give to my sister Harriet, who is delighted with the extracts I have copied for her?\"", "Will not that consume a large proportion of the five guineas, my generous friend?"]
["There is a new gown which I never have worn, which will serve for the new clothes my Lady spoke of to receive her son's bride.\"", "She entered on that subject then?"]
["Oh, sir, is it possible that she can know all about this young lady?\"", "What have you heard of her?"]
["\"Who say?"]
["\"Nevertheless I should be glad to hear.", "Was the servant old Grey?"]
["Aurelia needed little persuasion to tell all that she had heard from Mrs. Dove, and he answered, \"Thank you, my child, it tallies precisely with what the poor boy himself told me.\"", "\"Then he has told his mother?"]
["As if Lady Aresfield were fit to bring up an honest man's wife; and there's the fortune to fill up the void she has made in the Delavie estates.\"", "\"Can no one hinder it, sir?"]
["As a last resource the poor youth came hither to see whether the guardian whose wardship has hitherto been a dead letter, were indeed so utterly obdurate and helpless as had been represented.", "And you have the power?"]
["\"I was sure of it; and it is not true that they will be able to do without it?"]
["Have you heard any more?"]
["\"They will be quite propitiated by being asked to meet Dr. Godfrey,\" said Aurelia.", "Shall you admit them, sir?"]
["And if thou sparest now to do this thing, I will destroy thee and thy land also.--MORRIS.", "Well, sir, have you seen my Lady?", "Not a year older than when I saw her last,\" returned Major Delavie, who had just dismounted from his trusty pony at his garden gate, and accepted Betty's arm; \"and what think you?"]
["\"A very beautiful gem, a sleeping Cupid,\" he answered.", "How could the child have obtained it?"]
["At least it was no duel!", "What is it, dear sir?"]
["\"Is it come at last?"]
["exclaimed Betty, in a strange tone of discovery.", "May I inquire what you said?"]
["I cannot say what may actuate my Lady, but if Amyas Belamour be the man I knew, and as the child's own letters paint him, he is not like to lend himself to any such arrangement.", "Comes the offer from him, or is it only a scheme of my Lady's?"]
["\"We!", "Mistress Betty?"]
["\"Nay, sir, I cannot rest without going too; you might be taken ill.\" \"You cannot trust a couple of old campaigners like Palmer and me?"]
["The whole affair must wait, madam, till he is able to move.", "And if this illness be the consequence of one wet ride, how can he be in a condition to take the journey?"]
["Credit me, Betty, they will not serve in any world save the imaginary one that crazed Don Quixote.", "What advantage can the pretty creature gain?"]
["\"It could hardly be otherwise if he had to employ a secretary\" said her father.", "Who can have written for him?"]
["It was with a gasp of relief that Aurelia discovered what was required of her.", "\"Marry Mr. Belamour?", "Is that all?", "Then why should they all think I should so much dislike it, my Lady, and my papa, and sister and all?"]
["here are the little girls returning!", "Keep them here?"]
["However, the well-known voice began, \"My fair visitor is very good in honouring me to-night.\"", "Was it coming?"]
["You have heard from your father?"]
["There was another silence, another space of tightened breath and beating heart, absolutely audible, and again a hushed, restless movement heralded Mr. Belamour's next words, \"Did I no tell you truly that my Lady devises most unexpected expedients?\"", "Then would you not have it so, sir?"]
["I know how kind you are, sir.", "And you trust me?"]
["\"I will use my best endeavours to requite that trust, my child,\" he said.", "\"Is not the Christian watchword faith, not sight?"]
["He then interrogated her somewhat closely as to the letters which had prepared her for the proposal; and as Aurelia was far too simple to conceal anything under cross-examination, Mr. Belamour soon found out what her Ladyship's threats and promises had been.", "The Manor House?"]
["That is the original nucleus of the property which had hitherto gone to the heir male?"]
["\"Almost certainly she will have threatened to dismiss him if he do not consent.", "It was that which made my sister decide on sending me here, or what would become of him and Eugene?"]
["\"Precisely.", "You have heard from this maternal sister of yours?"]
["Surely he had been shaving!", "Was the time for which he bade her wait, his full recovery, and the resumption of the youthfulness that seemed to come on him in fits and starts, and then to ebb away, and leave him the grave courteous old man she had first known?", "And why was it always in a whisper that he spoke forth all those endearments which thrilled her with such strange emotions?"]
["Strange that while he was uttering this almost peremptory dismissal, she should feel herself in a clinging grasp, most unwilling to let her go!", "What did it all mean?"]
["However, she had hardly reached her room, before there was a knock at the door, and the giggling, blushing entrance of Molly with \"Please, ma'am, Madam Belamour, I wishes you joy with all my heart.", "Please can't I do nothing for you?"]
["And now, my dear Madam Belamour,\" he add playfully, \"tell me whether there is any wish that I can gratify.\"", "You are very kind, sir---\" \"What does that pause mean, my fair friend?", "I fear it is too much to ask, sir, but since you inquire what would please me most, it would be if you could spare me to go to my sister Harriet's wedding?"]
["The daring hope Aurelia had entertained of shopping for a day, with Mrs. Aylward as an escort, and choosing the last fashions to send to her sisters was quashed by the grave reply that it was better not for the present.", "What was the meaning of all this mystery, and when was it to end?"]
["It seems hard to put any restraint on your ingenuous confidence, my sweet friend; but I trust to your discretion to say as little as you can contrive of your strange position here, and of the infirmities and caprices of him whose name you have deigned to bear.\"", "Sir, do you think I could?"]
["\"Aurelia, what a sweet figure you make,\" cried Harriet, as the sisters unwound their arms after the first ecstasy of embracing one another again.", "Where did you get that exquisite habit?"]
["It was disappointing to find that her father had heard nothing from my Lady about the settlement of the Manor House.", "Was the promise in writing?"]
["I thought you were in a brown study.\"", "And in London, what do you think was all my gentleman cared to go and see?"]
["But la!", "says I, why should you talk about artfulness?"]
["There are two words to that question,\" said Harriet, oracularly; \"I know from good authority that young Sir Amyas is determined against the match.", "But is it true, ma'am,\" cried Mrs. Hunter, eagerly, \"that my Lady and the Countess of Aresfield met at Bath, and that my Lady is to have 3,000 pounds down to pay off her debts before her husband comes home, the day her son is married to Lady Arabella?"]
["Well now, that folk should sell their own flesh and blood!", "How have you heard it, sister Harriet?"]
["And now the Colonel keeps him on hard duty continually, and they watch him day and night to find out what places he haunts.", "But bless me, Mrs. Hunter, is the church clock striking?"]
["She was however much occupied with all she had heard, and was marvelling how her sister began again as soon as they were in the street again.", "You are very discreet, Aurelia, as it becomes a young married lady, but have you no notion who this innamorata of the baronet may be?", "No, indeed, how should I?"]
["Nay, I have always told you I am happy as the day is long.", "What, when you have never so much as seen your husband?"]
["Nor has he ever seen you?"]
["\"La!", "child, what heat is this?"]
["\"Yet if he loved you, he could never let you live moped up there.", "Are you never frighted at the dark chamber?"]
["said aurelia.", "Scarcely--when was that?"]
["\"You silly little chit!", "Why don't you encourage these advances?"]
["\"This is serious,\" said Harriet, with unwonted gravity.", "Do you really think that there is another person in the room?"]
["\"You ought not to bear it.", "How do you know that it is not some vile stratagem?"]
["He bade me be cautious how I talked, and you have made me quite forget!\"", "\"Did he so?"]
["His device will serve the purpose.", "Do you remember Eugene confounding him with Friar Bacon because he was said to light a candle without flint or steel?"]
["And it would hurt him.", "\"Tut, tut, child; if the lightning did not harm him how can this flash?"]
["Sir, sir!", "she cried, driven at last to bay, \"what is this?"]
["Tell her he is here, badly hurt.", "What, you do not know him,\" as her bewildered eyes and half-opened lips implied the question she could not utter, \"you do not know him?"]
["there was the trampling of horses and thundering of wheels at the door!", "Could the doctor be come already, and in such a fashion?"]
["cried Aurelia, with a gesture as if to screen him.", "I ask what this means?"]
["Oh!", "why did not Mr. Belamour come to her rescue?"]
["Home was her first thought.", "Who could shield her but her father and sister?"]
["But how reach them?"]
["Think of that!", "And have ee been out all night?"]
["if Harriet were only at Brentford, or if it were possible to reach the Lea Farm where she was!", "Could she ask her way thither, or could she find some shelter near or in Brentford till the coach or the waggon started?"]
["\"O Mrs. Wheatfield!", "Shall I ever see the dear little girl again?"]
["can you help me?", "Do you know where Lea Farm is?"]
["\"Well, I don't know as my master would hire a horse out of a Sunday, unless 'twere very particler--illness or suchlike.", "Lea Farm did you say ma'am?"]
["\"Never heard tell on him, ma'am, but the master might, when he comes in.", "But bless me,\" she added, after a moment's consideration, \"what will your master say?"]
["Ah!", "did she deserve it?"]
["No one saw her as the hob-nailed shoes trooped out of church, and soon she was entirely alone, kneeling still in her hiding-place, and whispering half-aloud the omitted morning prayer, whose heartfelt signification had, she felt, been neglected for a long, long time.", "Since when?"]
["All that justified her alarm was forgotten, her heartstrings had wound themselves round him, and began to pull her back.", "She had been sent from home, and bestowed in marriage to prevent his ruin, and should she now ensure it?"]
["In spite of his lameness, the Major had opened the door before Palmer could reach it; but his greeting and inquiry were cut short by the young man's breathless question: \"Is she here?\"", "Who?"]
["\"Come in, come in, sir,\" entreated Betty, seeing how fearfully pale he grew.", "What has befallen you, and where is my sister?"]
["I was married to her in his clothes, in the darkened room, our names being the same!\"", "Was this your promise?"]
["he said.", "Is there no mistake?"]
["\"That is the only rational thing I have heard,\" said the Major.", "Though--did your uncle expect your young blood to keep the terms?"]
["My Lady must have been very hard with her, to make her thus fly, all alone.\"", "You do not know, I suppose, any cause for so timid a creature preferring flight to a little restraint?"]
["\"Ay, I dare say,\" said the Major, a little amused.", "Well, sir, what could a man do with most bewitching creature in the world, his own wife, too, on the next chair to him?"]
["Hopes began to rise, and Major Delavie scolded Sir Amyas in quite a paternal manner whenever he began to despond, though the parts were reversed whenever the young people's expectations began to soar beyond his own spirits at the moment.", "\"Is yonder Hargrave?"]
["\"So she does to Hargrave, whom she sent off to interrogate Mrs. Arden,\" said Mr. Belamour.", "Have you any reason to think the child could have reached my Lady?"]
["Perhaps not in the camlet hood, which Dame Wheatfield says she wore.", "Was good old Dove acting as coachman?"]
["said the Major; \"but she is quite right.", "We should not get to town before ten or eleven at night, and what good would that do?"]
["\"It seems to me more like yours, sir,\" rejoined the youth; but at the hall door, with all his native grace, he turned and gave his welcome, kissing Betty on the cheek with the grave ceremony of the host, and lamenting, poor fellow, that he stood alone without his bride to receive them.", "Is that Jumbo?"]
["\"What I dread most is her being forced into some low marriage,\" said Mr. Belamour.", "It was that threat which moved you?"]
["You did your best, and if it did not succeed, it was owing to my foolish daughter Arden.", "Why, if she was not satisfied about her sister, could she not have come here, and demanded an explanation?"]
["Sir Amyas, taking Betty by the tips of her fingers, led her forward, receiving by the way greetings and inquiries from the servants, whose countenances showed him to be a welcome arrival.", "Is it a reception day, Maine?"]
["No, your honour.", "Is company with her ladyship?", "What did she see as Maine opened the door?"]
["Let Syphax give you a cup of chocolate.\"", "\"Madam,\" said the Major, disregarding all this and standing as if on parade, \"can I see you alone?"]
["\"Certainly not.", "\"Nor her sister?"]
["I entreat of you to tell me what you have done with her.\"", "\"How should I have done anything with her?", "How could a child like her do so?"]
["And we know,\" said Betty, fixing her eyes on the lady, \"that though she escaped, on the first alarm, as far as Sedhurst, and was there seen, she had decided on returning to Bowstead and giving herself up to you Ladyship.", "\"Indeed?"]
["I was pledged to her Majesty's card-table, and royal commands cannot be disregarded, so I had to go away in grievous anxiety for my poor boy.", "She meant to return to Bowstead, did she?"]
["Then one or other of them would speak, and we might know how she has been played upon.\"", "What does your Ladyship suppose then?"]
["Depend upon it, my unfortunate brother-in-law's wanderings at night were not solely spent in communings with the trees and brooks.", "Who knows what might be discovered if he were under proper restraint?"]
["\"Ah!", "my dear cousin, how do you think it is with my spirits?"]
["While as to dress, my woman can direct you to the milliner who would equip you in the last mode.", "What, still obstinate?"]
["\"At last I have escaped,\" he said.", "I fear you have waited long for me?"]
["I should imagine my Lady as ignorant as we are, save for one thing.\"", "And that was---?"]
["said the Major; \"do not let him get a handle against you, though I should not call you fit for duty yet, even for holiday-work like yours.\"", "You still suspect that your mother knows where our Aurelia is?"]
["I see, she communicated them to you.", "Did she ask your cooperation, Major?"]
["What, my Lord I thought you knew I never meant to dance again.", "Cannot you open the dance without me?"]
["In the fire, madam.", "\"What?"]
["\"Not precisely,\" he said.", "Come, now, tell me; did she set the room a-fire?"]
["My brother Mar's coachman told my mamma's woman all about it, and how she was locked up and ran away; but they have her fast enough now, after all her tricks!\"", "\"Who have?"]
["Your ladyship has not seen her.", "\"Have I not, though?"]
["Is she in Queen's Square?", "Do not you wish me to tell you where you can find your old faded doll, with a waist just like a wasp, and an old blue sacque--not a bit of powder in her hair?"]
["where you will never get at her!\"", "Is she at Queen's Square?", "\"What would you do if you thought she was?", "Get a constable and come and search?"]
["That's just the nonsense she talks!", "For Heaven's sake, what did she say?"]
["The tidings of Lady Arabella's secret were eagerly listened to, and the token of the mouse-coloured hair was accepted; Sir Amyas comparing, to every one's satisfaction, a certain lock that he bore on a chain next his heart, and a little knot, surrounded with diamonds, in a ring, which he had been still wearing from force of habit, though he declared he should never endure to do so again.", "It was evident that Lady Belle had really seen Aurelia; and where could that have been save at the famous boarding-school in Queen's Square, where the daughters of \"the great\" were trained in the accomplishments of the day?"]
["\"I would not let a breath blow on her that could touch the bloom of her charming frank innocence,\" cried the lad.", "\"But think you she can be in health?"]
["Thus,\" said Betty, seeing that the lady still needed to be appeased, \"we thought Lady Belamour might have deceived you as well as others.", "May I ask who said the young lady had been seen here?"]
["\"My Lady Arabella Mar is too often taken out by my Lady Countess,\" said Madame d'Elmar.", "\"Could I see her?"]
["Their twelve curtsies were made, their twenty-four eyes peeped more or less through their lashes at the visitor, but no such soft brown eyes as Aurelia's were among them.", "Madame,\" said Betty, \"may I be permitted to ask the ladies a question?"]
["Only Madame trusted to Mademoiselle's discretion not to put mysteries into their minds, or they would be all _tete montee_.", "So, as discretely as the occasion would permit, Betty asked whether any one had seen or heard Lady Belle speak of having seen any one--a young lady?"]
["\"It would be a great kindness,\" said Betty.", "Might I ask the favour of seeing Miss Howard in private?"]
["Belle had got some one to let her see the girl, and then she went on about her being not pretty.\"", "What did she say about sending her beyond seas?"]
["SPENSER.", "Nephew, is Delavie House inhabited?"]
["Something was said of St. Paul's, then in bloom of youth and the wonder of England; but Betty declared that she could not run about to see fine churches till her mind was at ease about her poor sister.", "Might she only go to the nearest and quietest church?"]
["Oh, sir, tell me the trick!", "Why--why keep me in torments, instead of taking me with you?"]
["And now?\"", "Is it impossible to effect an entrance from the court and carry her away?"]
["I know my daughter was here yesterday.", "\"And what do I know of where she be gone?"]
["I can give him no other Name, for his partial Aberration of Mind has only sharpened his natural Cunning.", "Would you believe it?"]
["Only, for pity's sake, do not put me among the poor wicked creatures in gaol.\"", "Get into that carriage immediately, and you shall know by decision,\" said Lady Belamour, with icy frigidness, but not the same fierceness as before; and Aurelia submissively obeyed, silenced by an imperious gesture when she would have asked, \"How is it with _him_?"]
["Remember that any attempt to communicate with any person outside the house will be followed by your Father's immediate dismissal.\"", "May I not let him know that I am safe?"]
["So that's the way!", "He has begun that work early, has he?"]
["The man in a green dressing gown with floating hair had a face she knew; so had the lady in the yellow ruff.", "And was that not the old crest, the Delavie butterfly, with the motto, _Ma Vie et ma Mie_, carved on the mantelpiece?"]
["The youngest son in the great family group was, as she knew, an Amyas, and he put her in mind of her own.", "Oh, was he her own, when she could not tell whether those great soft, dark-grey eyes that looked so kindly on her had descended to the young baronet?"]
["\"You'll have to put up with what serves your betters, I can tell you,\" was all the reply she received.", "Well be ye coming to your bed?"]
["You'll excuse me if I speak with you here, for I must be back by the time my Lady's bell rings.", "Is it very late?"]
["I must not stay, but it is my Lady's wish that you should have all that is comformable, and you'll let me know how Madge behaves herself.", "Is there any news from Bowstead?"]
["Here's half a pound of tea and sugar, which you had best keep to yourself, and I've seen to there being things decent down stairs.", "Tell me, my dear, is there anything you want?", "Your clothes, did you say?"]
["The weariness and languor of the former day's exertions made her for the present disinclined to explore the house, even had she had time, and when twilight came there could have been little but fragments at the bottom of the case, though she could see no more to sort them.", "And what were these noises around her making her start?"]
["Nearer, the view to the westward was closed in by a stately edifice which she did not know to be Somerset House; and from another window on the east side of the house she saw, over numerous tiled roofs, a gateway which she guessed to be Temple Bar, and a crowded thoroughfare, where the people looked like ants, toiling towards the great dome that rose in the misty distance.", "Was this the way she was to see London?"]
["\"Bible!", "what should ye want of a Bible, unless to play the hypocrite?"]
["Oh, how many there were of them!", "How many more would there be?"]
["How should she find patience in this dreariness, interspersed with fits of alarm lest he should be dangerously ill and suffering?"]
["Hark!", "what was that?"]
["He is to get up to-morrow, and then he will come and find you.", "Have you seen him?"]
["Are mothers kinder than Lady mammas?\"", "Was she angry?"]
["In the utter solitude, even this occupation would have been valuable, but with the little girls about her, and her own and their property, she had alternative employments enough to make it an effort to apply herself to this.", "Why should she?"]
["said Letty.", "His God Whom he trusted did deliver him out of the den of lions?"]
["\"Yes, one way or the other,\" said Aurelia.", "How do you think He will deliver us?"]

["You do intrude when you come with such ridiculous proposals--in fact, you intrude very often lately.\"", "Does Mr. Mostyn intrude?"]

["His own wrong was hard enough, but that he, who would gladly die for the Church, should put her to open shame!", "How could he bear it?"]
["He permitted him to come into his presence, but he rose as he entered, and walked hastily a few steps to meet him.", "What do you want here, sir?"]

["Tyrrel will go into politics.\"", "\"Will he, indeed?"]
["Ruth seems out of it all.", "Are you going to turn her adrift, or present her with a few thousand dollars?"]
["No one could give her better local advice, and Ethel quickly discovered that the best general social laws require a local interpretation.", "Are the Mostyns at the Hall?"]
["And with the words she took her by the hands and raised her to her feet, and looked at her with such a beaming, courageous smile that Dora caught its spirit, and promised to insist on her claims for rest and sleep.", "When shall I come again, Dora?"]
["\"Out of my house!", "What are you doing here?"]
["The gentry are against pulling one another down in any way, and this affair they don't want talked about.", "Being all of them married men, it isn't to be expected, is it?"]
["The women are standing up for her.", "Did you ever hear anything like that?"]
["And yet there were times when Tyrrel looked bored, and when nothing but Squire Percival's organ or Ethel's piano seemed to exorcise the unrest and ennui that could not be hid.", "Ethel watched these moods with a wise and kind curiosity, and in the beginning of September, when they perceptibly increased, she asked one day, \"Are you happy, Tyrrel?"]
["I am having a splendid holiday,\" he answered, \"but----\" \"But what, dear?"]
["She answered \"Yes,\" and as soon as she was alone fell to thinking, and in the midst of her meditation Mrs. Nicholas Rawdon entered in a whirl of tempestuous delight.", "What do you think?"]
["\"Whatever do you think?"]
["cried Ethel.", "And what are you going to call them?"]
["And just then I came into the room to have a look at the little lads, and when I heard what they were fratching about, I told them it was none of their business, that Lucy had the right to name the children, and they would just have to put up with the names she gave them.\"", "And has Lucy named them?"]
["Dearie me, Ethel, I am a proud woman this morning.", "Why is he against it?"]
["\"I am so glad.", "When shall we go?"]
["If a man could live for the sake of eating and sleeping and having a pleasant time, why Rawdon Court would be a heaven to him; but if he wants to DO something with his life, he would be most unhappy here.\"", "And you want to do something?"]

["He is really homesick.\"", "\"But this is his home, isn't it?"]
["I never heard the line.", "What will you do with the Court?"]
["But his birth has given me the power to repay to Fred Mostyn some of the misery he caused me.\"", "\"How so?"]

["Love will glorify everything.\"", "And we shall always love as we love now?"]
["Even to the end of our lives, Ethel?"]
["The two together bring Dora's affairs, I should say, to a pleasanter termination than we could have hoped for.\"", "Where is the Enchantress?"]
["But listen, she is living the quietest of lives; the most devoted daughter cannot excel her.", "\"Is she her own authority for that astonishing statement?"]
["Dora says she never intends to leave America again.\"", "\"Where is her husband?"]
["Mr. Denning persuaded Dora to write a statement of all the facts concerning the birth of the child.", "What makes you reiterate that description of him?"]
["He said it was 'sickening to remember the weariness of body and soul Dora had given him about a non-existing child, and though this could never be atoned for, he did think he ought to be refunded the money Dora's contemptible revenge had cost him.\"'", "\"How could he?"]
["Do you remember Miss Sadler?\"", "\"That remarkable governess of the Surreys?"]
["And if her face was not handsome, she had a noble presence and a manner that was irresistible.\"", "And she took Mostyn's part?"]

["To think that at this first meeting it should be _Rob_ who was left out in the cold, and not Hector; Rob who stood aside and was silent, Hector who laughed and talked with the ease of intimate friendship!", "It gave her a miserable feeling of self-reproach that it should be so; and yet how was she to blame?"]
["Rob's dark face softened tenderly as he looked at the little figure sitting so erect by his side, with the flush of excitement on her cheeks, and her young eyes aglow with enthusiasm.", "Or a story-book?"]
["It's no satisfaction to them to possess anything, unless they can show it off to a so-called friend and make her green with envy.", "`What is the good of a nice house?"]
["That is Rosalind's cry, when by any chance we are without visitors for a week at a time.", "`What is the use of wearing pretty clothes?"]
["Look here, though, I've got an idea which I present as a peace-offering.", "If you don't succeed in getting a house near town, what do you say to Yew Hedge, in our neighbourhood?"]
["I won't!", "How can I be fond of her when she makes you unhappy?"]
["\"Yes, I will!", "I'll do anything you want, but, oh, why did you do it?", "Why did you fall in love at all?"]
["Eunice gripped her companion's arm and pointed breathlessly to the feet peeping out beneath the short white skirt.", "The flat black shoes with the sandal-like crossings were the exact counterpart of those in the picture; but how in the name of mystery had Peggy managed to produce them?"]
["\"Seeing that you asked me twice over if I took sugar, and on hearing that I did not, immediately ladled in the largest pieces you could find, I conclude that there is something weighing on your mind,\" he said markedly.", "\"What is it?"]
["There is no fear of my being bored, and I promise faithfully to be so far from shocked that I will do every single thing that you do yourself.\"", "Go round with the crowd and see the animals feed?"]
["Give biscuits to the elephants?"]
["Finest beast you can find.\"", "And nuts to the monkeys?", "\"Er--is that a necessary condition?"]
["Walk round the parrot-house and examine every cage, and offer your finger to be bitten?"]
["The Pwince and Pwincess will be there, and everybody who is in town, and there is to be a pastowal play beneath the trees, so that altogether it will be worth seeing.", "You will come, won't you, Peggy?"]
["\"Oh, we must go, we must manage it!", "We have no engagement for Friday, Peggy, have we?"]
["She was tall and dignified, her clothes were quite miraculously tidy, and the smooth, fair hair was plaited in Puritan fashion round the head.", "Can it--can it be?"]
["The fat one is a lovable little soul, but terribly stupid and lazy; a great trial to my patience.", "I suppose Mellicent has told you all about my work, and how happy I am?"]
["Mr Asplin looked at her critically.", "_Was_ it Peggy?"]
["For the rest, the hazel eyes were as clear and loving as ever, and the old mischievous gleam shone through the tears.", "Is it Mariquita?"]
["The vicar's shoulders were more bowed; the lines on his face more deeply graven; his wife's hair had grown silvery about the temples, and the pathetic, tired look in the grey eyes must surely be permanent nowadays, since not even the excitement of meeting could chase it away.", "She was even sweeter-looking than of old, but had she always been so thin, so transparently delicate in colour?"]
["I told her it was no use, that you would have out all the best things, whatever we said.\"", "\"But you didn't, Mrs Asplin, did you?"]
["I might have known that he would come.", "But how?", "When?", "Where?"]
["Esther said solemnly; but Peggy marched determinedly out of the room, and, with the exception of Mr and Mrs Asplin and Arthur, every one followed and stood looking on while she pushed open the swing door of the cloak-room, and poked her little head round the corner.", "Where's my peg?"]
["I must see cook after tea, and Diddums, my sweet little kitten.", "How is the darling?"]
["Let me be silly for just one day.", "_What_, is that Diddums?", "That ugly, lanky, old cat?"]
["she cried in a rapture, and the colonel tugged at his moustache with a smile of complacent satisfaction.", "\"Looks about right, Peg, doesn't it?"]
["There's nothing like them for lasting!\"", "\"Like _what_?"]
["\"Ay, geraniums for sure, and calcies, and lobelias, and a nice little hedge of pyrethrum.", "Can't do better than that, can yer?"]
["a dozen times in succession, her very powers of exclamation seemed to depart, and she was reduced to sighs and grunts of response.", "In the middle of the history of a jungle plant which was the glory of the collection, Rob suddenly lifted his head and put a startling question: \"Are you interested?"]
["\"Not--_much_, Rob!", "It's curious, of course, but very `niggly,' don't you think?"]
["You said that you were sure fourteen pieces would be enough; and we told you at the time to be careful, as it had to be made!", "\"Ay, it do seem a pity, don't it?"]
["Then he jerked his thumb towards the flower-beds, and put a deprecatory question: \"Didn't you like them, then?"]
["I thought, maybe, they was something special, from the care they took about 'em.\"", "He gave an explanatory kick with his foot to the weeds piled up on the gravel path, and there was a pause of two whole minutes before a weak little voice inquired faintly: \"Who took such care?", "Who put them in?"]
["\"That was very kind of you,\" she said.", "\"It would be a silly trick, would it not?", "Do you think you could boil the kettle for me now?"]
["He knew that his wife's expeditions into town invariably demanded toll in the shape of a nervous headache the next day, and hastened to raise his usual note of protest.", "Why need she go?", "Could she not send her order by post, or could not Peggy buy what was wanted?", "Why tire herself needlessly, when she had no strength to spare?"]
["Peggy heard him catch his breath in a struggling sigh, and for a moment his eyes met her own, anxious and troubled.", "Well?"]
["Whatever happens now, I have been one of the most fortunate of women, and dare not complain.", "So tell me, please, what does it mean?"]
["I fear you must face increasing weakness and languor.\"", "\"And for--how long?"]
["Some one was talking at the other end of the room in a quiet, level tone, as if nothing extraordinary had happened.", "It was surely--surely not Mrs Asplin herself?"]
["I should like to ask one more question.", "Shall I be doing my husband a wrong in keeping this from him?", "Could he do anything to prolong my life?"]
["They were friends indeed, though they met for the first time to-day; for they were bound together by the closest of ties, in that they both served and trusted a common Master!", "Had He ever failed her?"]
["sighed Peggy to herself.", "\"What on earth can I talk about next?"]
["Do tell me!", "Do you know what it is like to be shy?"]
["You can never tell what good friends you may become.", "When I meet some one for the first time, I look into her eyes, and say to myself--`What is she?", "Why is she?", "What does she think?", "Right away down at the bottom of her heart, what is she like?"]
["Perhaps that story really meant that the man was shy and reserved, as you are, Eunice, and could never show his real self until he found friends to love and understand.", "I am not going to shed tears over you, my dear, but may I kiss you, please?"]
["responded Eunice unexpectedly.", "\"Peggy, some day, when there is nothing else to do and you are not tired, will you imitate people for me again?", "Will you?", "Will you do Hector Darcy and Miss Asplin and your father when he is angry?"]
["He himself had always been regarded as a sufficiently witty and interesting personage.", "How had it happened that he had failed where Peggy had succeeded?"]
["Why did you never tell me what a darling she was?"]
["\"Nice quiet girl indeed!", "Is that your verdict?"]
["Did you _ever_ see anything like her eyelashes?"]
["Whatever Arthur does, he does better than anybody else.", "He will be a great man yet, won't he?"]

["She stared with penitent eyes into the accusing face, nodded her head once or twice, and said with conviction: \"I'm a little wretch!", "Who am I, I should like to know, to judge another girl?"]
["On the contrary, a most well-satisfied and complacent young woman had she appeared, and Miss Peggy shrewdly suspected that the present distaste was but a transient emotion.", "If you are so tired of it, why don't you go down to the country, or join your mother abroad?"]
["I twy to forget it, and be happy, but evewy now and then the wemembwance comes back like a sudden pain, and catches my bweath.", "Oh, Peggy, isn't it difficult--isn't it twying?"]
["Her eyes were astonishingly bright, and there was a patch of colour on each cheek.", "\"Pray, why _should_ I be sorry?"]
["You could never have the courage to give up all those good things.", "Why should you, indeed?"]
["\"Come down this path to the end of the shrubbery.", "If you are in trouble, can't I help you, Rosie?"]
["The iron had entered into her soul, for oh, that glance--that glance of cold anger and reproach!", "Could it indeed have come from Arthur--Arthur, who never looked at her in anger before--Arthur, between whom and herself there had never hovered a shadow of a cloud in all their happy, loving lives?"]
["Peg is a hasty little mortal, but you know how loving and staunch she is, and I am sure she had not the remotest intention of wounding you.", "What was it all about?"]
["She said that I looked upon it as a business arrangement, and seemed to think that I could never really care for any man.\"", "\"And was she misjudging you?"]
["Oh, Rosie!", "he cried brokenly, \"is it really so?", "Am I the happy man, dear?"]
["You love me, and that lays a new duty on us both.", "The question is--how much do you love me, Rosie dear?", "How much are you prepared to give up for my sake?"]
["In ten years, sweetheart,\" he looked at her with a smile so tender that her eyes fell before his, \"you will be young no longer.", "Do you love me enough to do it _willingly_?"]
["And to talk of being mawwied so soon--at once!\"", "\"What else can we do?"]
["That is all!\"", "But you won't--you won't do anything rash?"]
["She flew to meet him, and felt her spirits go up at a bound at the sight of his smile.", "Have you come to say you have forgiven me?"]
["\"Angry!", "When was I angry?"]
["Arthur laughed; a short, half-hearted laugh which ended in a sigh.", "\"Oh, is that all?"]
["The more they need from me the happier I am.", "Don't you know how you feel after listening to a beautiful sermon--that you really wish something disagreeable would happen, to give you an opportunity of behaving well and being sweet and unselfish?"]
["He did not attempt to contradict his sister's statements, but no doubt the fact that he was unable to do so was the bitterest drop in his cup.", "\"Oh, Arthur, I wonder why it is that the two things which you have cared for most in your life have both been denied to you?"]
["You worked hard, and thought of other people before yourself, and still nothing has gone right!", "How is it?", "Why is it?"]
["He hurried out of the room, leaving Peggy to continue her hairdressing operations with a tear trickling slowly over her cheek, and a speculative expression in her eye.", "Hungry?"]
["A week after her return to Yew Hedge, Peggy was on her way to tea at the vicarage, when she was joined by Rob Darcy, who jumped over a wall at her approach, and exhibited an extraordinary amount of surprise at seeing her, considering how long he had been on the outlook for just such an event.", "Where are you going, my pretty maid?"]
["It is a happy discovery for me, for I have no chance in the beaten lines, and it will be a solution of many difficulties if I can make a little money in this way.\"", "\"You will go away, you mean?"]
["queried Peggy, with a feeling that the foundations of the earth were giving way beneath her, and that life itself was a delusion, since, at a moment's notice, the pillar of strength on which she had depended above all others could calmly announce its own purpose of withdrawal.", "Do you mean that you will settle there altogether, and never come home any more?"]
["Two eager faces appeared pressed against a window, and Mrs Asplin and Mellicent hurried out into the hall to greet their visitors and escort them into the schoolroom with an air of suppressed excitement.", "What do you think?"]
["_What_ do you think we have got to show you in the drawing-room?", "\"What do you think?"]
["Animal.", "Fine or superfine?"]
["\"How strict you are, to be sure!", "Well, then, is it mineral?"]
["Vegetable?"]
["Animal?"]
["Ornamental?"]
["and the vicar could throw no further light on the subject than to say that he agreed with both.", "It is useful then?"]
["Peggy turned to Rob with a gesture of despair, and then started afresh on a different tack.", "\"Is it an article in general use?"]
["No, no!", "In our house?"]
["from Mrs Asplin.", "In Rob's house?"]
["Could you have more than one in any house at the same time?"]
["\"You _could_, but one at a time is enough for most people.", "\"Especially in a small house, because where should we sit in the evening?"]
["they murmured thoughtfully.", "\"What can it be?"]
["It is--_An Engaged Couple_!\"", "A _wh-wh-what_?"]
["That, of course, was impossible, while Oswald was already a married man, and Mellicent obviously out of the question.", "Who could it be?"]
["\"Not Fraulein?"]
["Oh, Esther, Esther!", "Who would have thought it?"]
["What about the ladies' school?\"", "\"Is she fond of him?", "Is he fond of her?", "When did it happen?", "When did they come?", "How did they break it to you?"]
["\"I never, no, never, heard anything so exciting.", "Did she tell you that I met them in London?"]
["Dear, dear me, how I do long to peep in at the drawing-room window!", "Do you think they would mind very much, if they looked up and saw my face flattened against the pane?", "Proper?", "Mediocre?"]
["Such, however, was evidently not the case, for no sooner was the garden reached than she burst into impetuous speech.", "\"Oh, Peggy, child, isn't this delightful?", "Isn't it beautiful?", "Isn't it just the most wonderful and unexpected answer to my prayers?"]
["`A soldier of Christ!'", "_I_ could be that as well as Arthur, and I have been longing to fight all my life... How does it go?"]
["I do indeed rejoice in your happiness,\" murmured Peggy sweetly, and pecked her cheek with a condescending kiss.", "Esther's face disappeared for a moment, and came into view again with a fine access of colour and such an expression of anguish as seemed incomprehensible to those who did not know with what force Peggy's foot had been pressed on a pet corn, or had not heard the threatening whisper, \"You _would_, would you?"]
["The conversation during tea-time was conducted mainly between the professor and Miss Saville, and that young woman's friends listened with amazed admiration to the high-flown eloquence of her remarks.", "Who would have believed that Peggy was so well read, or able to conduct so learned a conversation?"]
["As a rule one seems to entirely absorb the other,\" sighed Miss Peggy happily, then turned to accost Esther with uplifted finger.", "Esther, oh, Esther, who would have thought it?"]
["I must say it's very hard on me, to have a sister who never takes my feelings into account.", "What is the good of having a wedding at all, if it isn't properly done with a choral service and bridesmaids and pretty frocks?"]
["If I could afford it a hundred times over, I would not condescend to such folly.", "Would you, Peggy?"]
["Naturally, however, it was Peggy who first broke the silence.", "\"Then you thought it well over, Esther,\" she said slowly, \"and decided that you would rather marry the professor than go on with your work?"]
["To be with him and help him is all I care for now.\"", "\"And it was no effort, none at all, to give up what you had worked for all your life?"]
["It is all just as it should be, and I can see you are going to be an ideal Darby and Joan.", "You will forgive me, won't you, for saying that his collar was dusty, for how was I ever to guess that he was going to belong to you?", "After all, what is dust, that it should be allowed to affect our estimate of a fellow-creature?"]
["Do what she would, she could not control the inward spasm of laughter; her shoulders heaved and shook, and Mrs Asplin felt the movement, and turned a quick glance upon her.", "\"Laughing?", "What for?", "Don't you like them then?"]
["Just give me your orders!\"", "Could anything have been more diplomatic?"]
["echoed Peggy blankly.", "If everything is settled, in what way do you want my help, Rosalind?"]
["If he knew I had taken him for his position, he would despise me, and I don't want him to do that.", "I have given up so much, and if he turned against me too, what should I have left?"]
["\"You have no business to say anything of the kind.", "If he is disappointed in me, won't that make him miserable, and if I twy to please him, is not that making him happy in the best way possible?"]
["She sat silent for a moment, gathering courage to ask another question which was fluttering to her lips.", "Will--will--do you think Arthur will be _vewy_ miserable?"]
["Eunice Rollo!", "Could anything be more wounding to the vanity which made her treasure the idea of broken-hearted grief?"]
["he grumbled, pushing his chair back from the table and preparing to leave the room.", "\"When do you _not_ get your way, I'd like to know?"]
["Peggy ran after him with a little skip, slipped her hand through his arm, and rubbed her face coaxingly against the shoulder of his rough tweed suit.", "\"He is just a down-trodden old dear, isn't he?"]
["He never lays down the law as if he were the Tsar of All the Russias, or twenty German Emperors rolled into one!", "Now does that really mean that you are to be out for lunch?"]
["pleaded her mother earnestly.", "\"We are so entirely in the country that a day might come when you were not able to get supplies at the last moment, and _then_ what would you do?"]
["Detest out-of-door meals.", "\"How,\" she demanded, \"could she be expected to make anything out of nothing?"]
["What were Peggy's feelings then, on going to her key basket, to find it lying empty on the floor, with never a sign of its contents to be seen!", "Where had she put them?"]
["But where had she placed it?", "Where, oh, where?"]
["I should have given out the stores yesterday, but I put it off, miserable, procrastinating wretch that I am!", "Oh, keys, keys, where are you, keys?"]
["At the end of ten minutes' time she was in a more pitiable plight than before, since every likely place had been explored, and not the wildest idea had she where next to repair.", "Wh-at,\" quoth the housemaid tremblingly, \"what shall I say to cook?"]
["That was the only part of the proceeding of which she had any dread, but, as it turned out, she was not to attempt it, for before she had ascended two rungs of the ladder a voice called her sharply by name, and she turned to find Hector Darcy standing by her side.", "For pity's sake, Peggy, what are you doing?"]
["\"Come down this instant!", "How dare you be so rash?"]
["sighed Peggy dolefully.", "\"Oh, why did you come and interrupt?"]
["I was going into the house to give myself a brush up in your father's room, and I saw a glimpse of your dress through the tree.", "\"And the others--are they coming too?"]
["They are sitting with your mother, having a smoke until lunch is ready.", "You need not be afraid; but tell me what is the matter?"]
["\"I will stay and help you,\" he said firmly; \"that will be better than going away!", "You don't expect me to walk off and leave you to risk your little neck climbing up ladders to provide food for me, do you?"]
["The window was small, and Hector was big; she was afraid he would find it no easy task, but his ready offer relieved and touched her more than she could express, for he had such an acute sense of his own dignity that it meant much for him to perform such a feat.", "\"You really mean it?"]
["\"Turned your foot!", "When did you do that?"]
["No!", "\"It has just begun to trouble you now?"]
["\"You two have been up to some mischief together since we arrived.", "What was it?"]
["Peggy always made a great affectation of being busy, and had at least half-a-dozen pieces of fancy work hidden away in as many drawers, waiting completion at that indefinite period when she should remember their existence.", "Why did he stare so fixedly?", "She would have liked to show her displeasure, but how could she, when he was suffering through her folly, and had been so chivalrous in shielding her from blame?"]
["Oh yes, indeed, I'll do all I can to cheer your solitude.", "You shall read aloud to me while I sew, and add up my accounts while I do my housekeeping, and--\" \"Seems to me that is rather the wrong way about, isn't it?"]
["Rob came forward slowly, and Peggy heard as in a dream the murmur of the two voices, questioning, replying, making arrangements for the future, but for her own part she could not stir nor lift her eyes from the floor.", "What would Rob think?", "What _could_ he think?"]
["The most she could do was to give Rob an opportunity of speaking, which she did without delay, walking with him to the gate, and keeping purposely silent the while; but it was of no use, for he seemed resolved to avoid personal subjects, would not mention Hector's name, and discoursed on vegetable life to an audience inclined to wish that such a thing as plant or flower had never existed!", "Why was not he angry?"]
["Another girl might have realised that Rob had not the right to be angry, seeing that she was in no wise pledged to himself; but at heart Peggy considered herself pledged, and felt sore and wounded that Rob did not realise her position.", "Care for another man while Rob was near?"]
["Share her life with another, and leave Rob lonely and uncared for?"]
["The shy glance of the grey eyes affected Peggy with all the old pleasure, for they were so eloquent of their owner's enjoyment, so charmingly diffident as to the feelings of others.", "\"You dear little Eunice, how are you again?"]
["Here was a delightful confession!", "When you have abased yourself before a friend, have confessed your own shortcomings, and braced yourself to bear reproaches, what can be more delightful than to hear that her own ignorance is greater than yours?"]
["Every girl ought to be able to make her own clothes, and it's so simple, so easy.\"", "Is it?"]
["Have you ever tried?"]
["You get a pattern, pin it to the stuff, cut it out, run it up, and there you are.\"", "And you really think I could manage?"]
["This will be the exception, however, and it will be nice to be alike!\"", "\"Thank you so much; but you won't tell any one what we are going to do, will you?"]
["Four days are quite enough; besides, it is really five, for we will begin this morning.\"", "\"Now?", "At once?"]
["Something I brought from town, and I want you to carry it for me.\"", "So likely, isn't it?"]
["\"It shall never be said of me that I trained my brother so badly that I carried even an umbrella in his company!", "What is it, Arthur?", "Do tell us?"]
["Esther fled precipitately behind a screen, Mellicent flopped on a chair, and Mrs Asplin cried loudly: \"Go away, go away.", "Come in, dear boy!", "Is it really you?"]
["cried Mellicent severely, and at this Mrs Asplin turned towards Eunice with her sunny, welcoming smile.", "\"You are Miss Rollo, aren't you, dear?"]
["I wouldn't make you jibber for the world, Chubby, so I'll knock next time, to let you know I'm coming.", "But where's the bride?", "Where's the bride?"]
["\"The great Miss Rollo,\" however, turned out to be a simple-looking girl, who looked much more afraid of her companions than her companions were of her, while when she came face to face with Arthur he seemed suddenly sobered, and uttered his congratulations in quite a quiet, earnest voice.", "Was this Esther?", "he was asking himself--this rosy, smiling girl the sober, long-visaged Esther who had seemed so far removed from youthful romance?"]
["The dream seemed to him to have lasted quite a long time, but in reality the pause was but of a moment's duration, and had been abundantly filled by Mellicent, who having spied Arthur's parcel was consumed with curiosity to discover its contents.", "What's in the box?"]
["cried Mellicent the irrepressible.", "\"Who took the little blue jug off my mantelpiece?", "Who took the pictures from the schoolroom?", "Who took the toilet-cover that she said I might have, and left me with nothing but two horrid mats?"]
["It was very, very kind of Arthur, and she was truly grateful.", "Should she open the parcel now?"]
["I hope it may be nothing of the kind; I might have known it was a trick.", "Now, what is in the other parcels?"]
["The child is half alive, but if some one woke her up--I wonder now if Arthur--\" She turned suddenly, and met Arthur's eyes fixed upon her, intent and questioning, as if for some reason he was keenly interested in her impressions of Eunice Rollo.", "Was it imagination, or did he flush beneath her questioning glance?"]
["It will be a pleasant break in the midst of our preparations.", "Where do you think of going?"]
["A two hours' journey would take them within five miles of an East Coast village, where some years before he had discovered an ideal spot for a picnic.", "There were a few good boats to be obtained, and the fishermen would help Rob and himself to row the party across, while, once arrived on the island, what could be more delightful than to sit on the sand with the waves splashing up to their very feet, to drink in the fresh sea breeze, and enjoy their luncheon under the shade of the trees?"]
["\"`Place the perforated edge on the bias of the cloth!'", "Which is the perforated edge?", "Which is the bias?"]
["quoth Miss Peggy in a tone of dismay, and peaked solemn brows over her work.", "\"What is the matter?"]
["She spoke in a studiedly careless manner, but Eunice's face was a picture of woe.", "To her orderly mind the accident seemed irretrievable; and yet how was it to be remedied, when extravagant Peggy had used every fragment of her material?"]
["How dreadful!", "What will you do?"]
["The back is too wide-- take a great handful out of the middle seam.", "Why does it stick out like that at the waist, just where it ought to go in?"]
["Oh, those sleeves!", "Who would ever have believed that it could be so difficult to fit such simple things, or to persuade them to adapt themselves to holes expressly provided for their accommodation?"]
["I can't waste all my life fussing over a pair of sleeves.", "What can it matter whether they are put an inch one way or the other?"]
["They were asking how your dressmaking was getting on the other day, so I am sure they will be glad to accept.", "You won't want an answer, I suppose, Mistress Housekeeper?"]
["I'll die of asphyxiation.", "What shall I do?", "What shall I do?"]
["Now I should be fairly comfortable, if only--only--the sleeves were a little bigger!", "It is too late to let them out, but just round the arm-holes, eh?"]
["No seam could be expected to hold, if treated in such fashion.", "How would Peggy like it if her sleeve came off altogether in the course of the evening?"]
["Plain as her blouse was, it was a remarkable success for a first effort, and though it had necessarily a dozen faults, the whole effect was neat and dainty.", "What did I tell you?"]
["\"Who looks better now, you or I?"]
["Only for one moment, however, for the next she decided roundly against so mean a course.", "What if she had failed?", "her guest had succeeded, and why rob her of praise well-earned?", "After all, would she not have been a hundred times more distressed if positions had been reversed, and Eunice was suffering her present discomfort?"]
["Perhaps at heart she was even a little grateful to him for being so anxious to enjoy her society, for no one else seemed to desire it for that moment.", "Colonel and Mrs Saville were talking contentedly together, Arthur was engrossed with Eunice, Rob--ah, where was Rob?", "Had he made up his mind never to enter Yew Hedge again?"]
["cried the girls in chorus, while the men looked at each other, braced themselves up, and said: \"We can do it.", "Why not?"]
["Large as they were, however, there was one member of the party who seemed diffident about their sea-going quality, and, wonderful to relate, that person was Peggy herself.", "Is it safe?"]
["\"Is it safe?"]
["\"I was not thinking of myself.", "It is possible sometimes to be nervous for another,\" she blurted out, and the next moment wished her tongue had been bitten off before she had uttered such a rash remark; for what could Rob think, or his companions either, but that the person for whom she was anxious was present among them?"]
["She heard her own voice murmur words of conventional regret, but Hector took no notice except to look still deeper into her eyes.", "Am I to go alone, Peggy?"]
["It's all a mistake.", "How could I help you?"]
["I know quite well how much harm I have done you.\"", "\"Do you, Peggy?", "I don't agree with you there; but if it is so, is not that all the more reason why you should do me a good turn now?"]
["\"I am not a boy, Peggy.", "I know what I want, but you--you are so young, how can you be sure of yourself yet?"]
["Even at that critical moment a gleam of fun twinkled in Peggy's eyes.", "\"Oh, Hector, how can you?"]
["I should be so cross, if she said that to me, that I should want to shake her.", "How could you be friends with a person who had made you so miserable?"]
["It is running strong!", "I say, what about that boat?"]
["This is a nice state of things!", "\"What _is_ to be done?"]
["\"I should like to shoot myself for my stupidity!", "Why could I not have thought of the tide when we were beaching the boat?"]
["Arthur's eyes turned from the boat for the first time, and he hastened to her side.", "\"Why, Peg,\" he cried, \"what's the matter, dear?"]
["\"It is not a subject for jokes.", "Seriously, Arthur, how long may we have to stay?"]
["Don't look so miserable, Peggy; I promise you, you shall come to no harm.\"", "\"But, mother--Mrs Asplin--what will they think?", "If we don't get back until late, can we send a telegram to them?"]
["and then a voice spoke to her by name, and she looked up, to see Rob's anxious face looking into hers.", "\"What is it, Peggy?"]
["Can you tell me?"]

["Now if they had any religion whatever, you might, by pointing out to them the falsity and absurdity of that religion, and putting it in juxtaposition with revealed Truth, have some hold upon their minds; but we have not even that advantage.\"", "\"But can not you make an impression upon their minds by referring to the wonders of nature,--by asking them who made the sun and stars?"]
["And even then not overcome, for the language has no words to express abstract ideas; but the Lord works after His own way, and at His own season.", "You do not then despair of success?"]
["I could hardly have believed that a concourse of savages could have been so attentive, and have behaved with such decorum.", "Do you think that there are many who, if I may use the term, feel their religion?"]
["That must be very satisfactory to you.", "\"It is; but what am I, and the few who labor with me, to the thousands and thousands who are here in darkness and require our aid?"]
["Strange to say, many who doubt and waver will listen to me there; but they appear to think that there is some witchcraft in the Mission church, or else are afraid to acknowledge to their companions that they have been inside of it.\"", "The missionary then left them, and Alexander observed-- \"I don't know how you feel?"]
["The oxen had already been yoked, and taking leave of the worthy missionary, our travelers mounted their horses and resumed their journey.", "What are they, and what does he say?"]
["\"No; it is something like old veal,\" replied Swinton.", "\"Now, what is Omrah about?"]
["A monkey is a fool to that boy,\" observed the Major, \"and he appears to know how to imitate every animal he has ever heard.", "Did you hear the dance he led some of the Hottentots on Sunday evening, when we were at the Mission?", "No; what was that?"]
["The great fault is, that when people have made a discovery to a certain extent, they build upon it, as if all their premises were correct; whereas, they have, in fact, only obtained a mere glimmering to light them to a path which may some future day lead to knowledge.", "And mesmerism?"]
["While they were conversing, Begum, who had been sitting by her master, showed signs of uneasiness, and at last clung round the Major with an evident strong fear.", "Why, what can be the matter with the Princess?"]
["Yes, that is evident; perhaps there is an elephant near; shall we waken Bremen and Swanevelt, who are close to us?"]
["Yes, I have, but very seldom.", "But it is rather singular that we have not heard the lion before this, is it not?"]
["\"I know very well, Swinton, that you are closely attentive to the peculiar habits of animals, and that they form a portion of your study.", "Have you much knowledge of the lion?"]
["It will soon be daylight, and then we must set off after them.\"", "Are those fellows quite sober now?"]
["\"That is our policy, depend upon it,\" replied Swinton.", "\"You are right, and we will do so; but the day is breaking; so?"]
["However, we must not expect to make a London footman out of a 'Child of the Desert.'\"", "Where is his adversary and antagonist, the valiant Big Adam?"]
["There are, however, many races mixed up with the Bushmen; for runaway slaves, brought from Madagascar, Malays, and even those of the mixed white breed, when they have committed murder or other penal crimes, have added to the race and incorporated themselves with them; they are called the Children of the Desert, and they are literally such.\"", "Have you seen much of them?"]
["Then I dance and jump about and shake my skin-dress, and the lion looks at me, and he turns round and walks away; he growls very much, but he don't stay, and then I eat the rest.'\"", "And is that true?"]
["The fact was, that he perceived a lioness devouring a wild horse, and went up to her as usual; but he did not observe that she had her whelps with her: he shouted; she growled savagely, and before he had time to retreat, she sprang upon him and tore him to pieces.\"", "The lion does not prey upon men, then, although he destroys them?"]
["As soon as Begum heard it, she ran up to the Major with every sign of trepidation, holding fast to his skin trowsers.", "What was that?"]
["I know what it is,\" said the Major; \"it is a herd of baboons; there they are; don't you see their heads over the rocks?"]
["At this sound the baboons halted, and listened in silence; again the growl was repeated, and followed up by the roar, and the baboons, at a shriek given by one on the rock, turned round and took to their heels, much to the delight of our travelers, who had felt the peculiar difficulty and danger of their situation.", "What animal was that which has frightened them off?"]
["It would not have been the first time that these animals have carried off a boy,\" said Swinton; \"I saw one at Latakoo, who had lived two years with the baboons, which had carried him off.", "How did they treat him?"]
["The Caffre warriors, who had been told that the white men were going to pray to their God, were very silent and attentive, although they could not understand what was said; and the native Caffres, men, women and children, sat down and listened.", "As soon as the service was over, the Caffre head man of the warriors asked the interpreter to inquire of our travelers why they struck the bell?", "was it to let God know that they were about to pray, and did he hear what they said?"]
["A great many other questions were put by the Caffres, all of which were replied to with great caution by Mr. Swinton, as he was fearful that they might not otherwise be understood by the Caffres; but they were, as it was proved by the questions which followed in consequence.", "Now white men come here as traders, or are occasionally seen here as travelers; and if the natives find, as they have found, that these white men, stated by the missionaries to hold the same belief, not only show no evidence of their belief, but are guilty of sins expressly forbidden by the religion preached, is not the work of the missionary nearly destroyed?"]
["Well, then,\" said the Major, \"now we can do without these cowardly fellows, who are no use to us but to eat and drink; so now let us discharge them at once, all but Bremen and Swanevelt.", "I agree with you, Major,\" said Alexander; \"what do you think, Swinton?"]
["Now I can not think that you will leave us; you know that we have treated you well, and have given you plenty of tobacco; you know that you will be punished as soon as you return to the Cape.", "Why then are you so foolish?"]
["The Hottentots now perceived their forlorn position.", "How could they, without arms and ammunition, and without provisions, return to the Cape, such a number of miles distant?", "How could they exist, if they remained where they were?"]
["\"Well, then, we must now hold a council,\" said Swinton.", "Of course, proceed you will, Wilmot, that is decided; the only question is, as we must now proceed on horseback, what force you will take with you, and what shall be left in charge of the wagons?", "I think we can trust the Caffres, do not you?"]
["I will accompany you, Wilmot, as I can speak better Dutch, and the interpreter will not get on well without me.\"", "Will you have the kindness to take charge of the wagons, Major, during our absence?"]
["In that reply he evidently refers to the wreck of the ship,\" observed Swinton; \"and I presume, from the fish-bones, which we have seen about the kraal, that these Caffres feed on fish, which the other tribes do not, and therefore it is that he says his mother feeds him.", "Was your mother white?"]
["Yes,\" replied Daaka, \"her skin was white as yours; her hair was just like yours, long and dark; but before she died it was quite white.", "What was your mother's name?"]
["Had you any brothers and sisters?"]
["What is her name?"]
["This is very confirmatory,\" said Alexander; \"my aunt's name was Elizabeth; she must have called her child after herself.", "Whom did your mother marry?"]
["In the evening the chief took his leave, and went to his own hut.", "As soon as they were alone, Alexander said to Swinton, \"I have now so far fulfilled my promise to my worthy relation that I have seen this descendant of his child; but what am I to do?"]
["My old relative fancies, in his mind's eye, his daughter weeping over her captivity, and longing to be restored to her country and her relations; still retaining European feelings and sympathies, and miserable in her position; her children brought up by her with the same ideas, and some day looking forward to their emancipation from this savage state of existence: I think if he were here, and saw old Daaka, he would soon divest himself of all these romantic ideas.\"", "\"I think so too; but there is one thing which has struck me very forcibly, Alexander, which is, if this Daaka is the son of your aunt how comes it that he is so old?"]
["Allowing her to marry at the earliest age, Daaka could not well be more than forty-eight years old; and surely he is more than that.\"", "\"He looks much older, certainly; but who can tell the age of a savage, who has been living a life of constant privation, and who has been so often wounded as his scars show that he has been?"]
["Daaka looked at him and shook his head, \"No, not my mother this,\" replied he; \"my mother down there,\" pointing out in a northerly direction.", "\"What does he mean, Swinton?"]
["\"I will speak to him, Wilmot; you are too much agitated,\" replied Swinton.", "Is not that the vessel which your mother was lost in?"]
["Our readers may imagine the impatience of Alexander while the questions of Swinton were being answered, and by which it appears that Daaka's mother was lost at the mouth of the Lauwanbaz, a small river some miles to the eastward of the Zemsooboo.", "Were there none of the _Grosvenor's_ people left in the country?"]
["None,\" replied the old man; \"they all went to the southward.", "Did you hear what became of them?"]
["Were none of the women and children saved and kept as slaves?"]
["You shall then tell me your adventures, while Mahomed fries a delicate piece of elephant's flesh for you.\"", "Have you killed an elephant?"]
["\"Well, I am of your opinion.", "\"I am equally desirous of going through that country, where I hope to shoot a giraffe,--that is my great ambition,\" replied Wilmot; \"therefore we may consider that we are all agreed, and the affair is settled; but the question is, how shall we proceed back?"]
["To effect this, Quetoo commenced his ravages upon all the lesser tribes tributary to Fakoo, and having put them to indiscriminate slaughter, driven away their cattle, and burned their kraals, his army advanced to the missionary station, which the missionaries were compelled to desert, and fall back upon the St. John River.", "One of the men belonging to the tribe near Morley came to the caravan where our travelers had halted, and, on being questioned as to the loss they had experienced, cried out, \"Ask not how many are killed, but how many are saved: our wives, where are they?"]
["No,\" replied Swinton, \"I have them already; I just thought it possible that you might have killed a zebra.", "\"Well, have we not?"]
["The true zebra hardly ever descends upon the plains, but lives altogether upon the mountainous regions; occasionally it may be found, it is true, and that is the reason why I came to see.\"", "Are they good eating, these animals?"]
["Very true, I fear; but we have a few stanch fellows among them, and two at least whom we can depend upon--Bremen and Swanevelt.", "How far is it from here to the Black River, Swinton?"]
["But before they had traveled three hours, they were surprised at a cloud of dust, which obscured the horizon, in the direction they were proceeding.", "What can that be?"]
["It is the want of food which has brought them so far to the southward.\"", "Their track is evidently from the north and eastward,\" said the Major; \"had we not better change our course more to the northward?"]
["We must be quiet here,\" said Bremen to Alexander; \"there are many lions round us, and our fire is not sufficient to scare them away, and they may attack us.", "Would it not be better to fire our guns,--that would frighten them?"]
["Then, again, they encroached upon the Caffres, driving them first beyond the great Fish River, and afterward still more to the northward.", "Which do you refer to?"]
["To produce this, Christianity must be introduced; for Christianity and civilization go hand in hand.\"", "But the Mantatees or Ficani, who are they?"]
["One, two, three--there are five of them.", "What are they?"]
["Its power of jaw is so great, that it breaks the largest bone with facility.\"", "Are there many varieties of them?"]
["Neither he nor the Hottentot, however, escaped without severe wounds, which confined them for many weeks.\"", "Is there more than one variety of leopard, Swinton?"]
["What do you propose doing to-day?"]
["There is a large body of gnoos and quaggas under that small hill to the westward; but there are better animals for the table when we get a little further to the northward.\"", "Which are those?"]
["When I was in the Namaquas' land, we preferred them to any other food; but I see another variety of game on the plain there.\"", "What?"]
["The interpreter told them that they were about to hunt, and that they should have some of the game, at which they were much pleased.", "Do you know what those straps are called, round their waists, Wilmot?"]
["Big Adam, who had no idea that Omrah was so occupied behind him, now rose to have a shot, and just as he rose the gnoo made his charge, and Big Adam, being between the gnoo and the horse which Omrah rode, was of course the party against whom the animal's choler was raised.", "Why, what has become of him?"]
["At last a portion of them were incorporated, and settled down on that part which is now known as the Mantatee new country; the remainder made an irruption into the eastern Caffre country, where they were known as the Ficani.\"", "And what became of them?"]
["They hear reports read, and find perhaps that the light of the Gospel has but as yet glimmered in one place or another; that in other places all labor has hitherto been thrown away.", "\"There I agree with you, Swinton,\" replied Alexander; \"but what are the objections raised against them?"]
["But I much question whether men of higher attainments and more cultivated minds would be better adapted to meet the capacities of unintellectual barbarians.", "A highly-educated man may be appreciated among those who are educated themselves; but how can he be appreciated by the savage?"]
["\"Besides, admitting that it would be preferable to employ persons of higher mental attainments, where are they to be found?", "Could you expect, when so many laborers are required in the vineyard, a sufficient number of volunteers among the young men brought up at the universities?", "Would they be able to submit to those privations, and incur those hardships, to which the African missionaries are exposed?", "Would they be able to work hard and labor for their daily bread, or be willing to encounter such toil and such danger as must be encountered by those who are sent here?"]
["\"The Almighty, as if to prove how insignificant in his sight is all human power, has often made use of the meanest instruments to accomplish the greatest ends.", "Who knows but that even our keeping holy the Sabbath-day in the desert may be productive of some good, and be the humble means of advancing the Divine cause?"]
["The print of another foot was observed by Omrah, and he pointed it out; but not knowing the name to give the animal in English or Dutch, he imitated its motions.", "Does he mean a gnoo?"]
["Omrah shook his head, and, raising his hands up, motioned that the animal was twice as big.", "Come here, Bremen; what print of a hoof is this?"]
["Well, we must not return without one, at all events,\" said Alexander; \"nor without a lion also, as soon as we can find one alone; but those we have seen in the daytime have always been in threes and fours, and I think the odds too great with our party; but the first single lion we fall in with, I vote we try for his skin.", "Agreed,\" replied the Major; \"what do you say, Swinton?"]
["However, depend upon it, if you go after a lion I shall be with you: I have often been at the destruction of them when with Dutch boors; but then recollect we have no horses to spare, and therefore we must not exactly follow their method.\"", "How do they hunt the lions, then?"]
["\"I see,\" replied the Major.", "What are they?"]
["The Bushmen know the animal and his habits so well, that they seldom come to any accident from their inhabiting a country in which I really believe the population of lions exceeds that of Bushmen.\"", "Is it true that the lion, as well as other animals, is afraid of the eye of man?"]
["Muller again was quiet, and the animal continued turning and growling as it moved off, till at last it bounded away.\"", "You imagine then, that the lion is aware of the fatal effects of fire-arms?"]
["In fact, the lion is no more than a gigantic cat, and he must live by obtaining his prey in the same manner as a cat.", "\"In these countries, his prey is chiefly of the antelope species, the swiftest animals on earth; and what chance would he have, if he were to give one of his magnanimous roars to announce his approach?"]
["I am glad to have heard your narrative, Major,\" replied Swinton; \"for many doubts have been thrown upon the question of the power of the human eye, and your opinion is a very corroborative one.", "Do not you imagine that the lion-tamers who exhibit in Europe have taken advantage of this peculiar fact?"]
["I have witnessed these exhibitions, and always observed that the man never for a moment took his eyes off the animal which he was playing with or commanding.", "I have observed that also; but what are the other means to which you allude?"]
["I believe that repeated blows upon the nose will go further than any other means to break the courage of any beast, and I imagine that these are resorted to: but it is only my opinion, recollect, and it must be taken for just as much as it is worth.\"", "Do not you think that animals may be tamed by kindness, if you can produce in them the necessary proportion of love and fear?"]
["After sundry kicks in the ribs, the fellow at last woke up.", "Is it your watch?"]
["We unyoked and lay down on the sand for the night; there were the farmer and I, two Hottentot men and a woman--by the by, a very fat one, and who consequently was more heated by the journey.", "Was the woman killed?"]
["\"Not half so much as I have been frightened myself,\" replied the Major; \"we have all had a narrow escape.", "Is Swanevelt hurt?"]
["Their calendar, such as it is, is mainly from recollections of feasting; and I will answer for it, that if one Bushman were on some future day to ask another when such a thing took place, he would reply, just before or just after the white men killed the buffaloes.\"", "How do they live in general?"]
["They poison the pools for the game also; but their living is very precarious, and they often suffer the extremities of hunger.\"", "Is that the cause, do you imagine, of their being so diminutive a race, Swinton?"]
["Continual privation and hardships from generation to generation have, I have no doubt, dwindled them down to what you see.\"", "\"How is it that these Bushmen are so familiar?"]
["But we must expect to meet with others that are equally wild, and who will be very mischievous; attempting to drive off our cattle, and watching in ambush all round our caravan, ready for any pilfering that they can successfully accomplish; and then we shall discover that we are in their haunts without even seeing them.\"", "How so?"]
["\"I never felt the full force of the many similes and comparisons in the Scriptures, where the lion is so often introduced, till now,\" observed Alexander.", "\"It was indeed a most awful sermon after the prayers,\" said the Major: \"I trust never to hear such a one again: but is it not our own fault?"]
["They then dip the heads of the arrows into it, and let it dry on.\"", "Is then the venom of snakes so active after it has been taken away from the animal?"]
["The fang had merely grazed the skin of the two sons when they put on the boots, and had thus caused their death.\"", "Are the snakes here as deadly in their poison as the rattlesnake of America?"]
["The mountain adder is small, and, from its not being so easily seen and so easily avoided, is very dangerous, and its bite as fatal as the others.\"", "I trust that is the end of your catalogue?"]
["I made an inquiry at the Moravian Mission, where these venomous snakes are very plentiful, how many people they had lost by their bites, and the missionaries told me, that out of 800 Hottentots belonging to the Mission, they had only lost two men by the bites of snakes during a space of seven years; and in other places where I made the same inquiry, the casualties were much less in proportion to the numbers.\"", "Is the boa constrictor found in this part of Africa?"]
["\"The South American Indians have a very subtle poison with which they kill their game.", "Are you aware, Swinton, of its nature?"]
["The natives, however, add the poison of snakes to the extract; and the preparation is certainly very fatal, as I can bear witness to.\"", "Have you ever seen it tried?"]
["Mr. W. said that the effects would have been instantaneous, if the virtue of the poison had not somewhat deteriorated from its having been kept so long.\"", "The wourali poison only acts upon the nerves, I believe?"]
["But the poison of snakes acts upon the blood, and therefore occasions death without remedy.\"", "But there are remedies, I believe, for even the most fatal poisons?"]
["It is impossible to say, but, so far as I could judge, there was no deception.\"", "\"I think it very possible; if the plant will cure the ichneumon, why not a man?"]
["Yes, they have probably remained behind to eat the lion.", "What, will they eat it now that it has been poisoned?"]
["They do not, however, eat them raw; they pull off their wings and legs, and dry their bodies; they then beat them into a powder.\"", "Do you suppose that St. John's fare of locusts and wild honey was the locust which we are now referring to?"]
["I think we have now gone far enough for to-day; we may as well halt there.", "Do you intend to hunt, Major?"]
["They said that there were plenty at the mouths of the rivers, on the coast of the Eastern Caffres, but I am astonished to find one here.\"", "What did you fire at?"]
["However, as people are now better informed, they do not reject so positively; for they have certain rules to guide them between the possible and the impossible.\"", "How do you mean?"]
["And why?"]
["So that even what has been considered as fabulous has arisen from exaggeration or mistake.\"", "You think, then, Swinton, that we are bound to believe all that travelers tell us?"]
["said Alexander.", "Is the nest a joint concern?"]
["\"Hold hard,\" said the Major, \"there is a lion; what a terrible black mane he has got!", "What do you say, Swinton?"]
["As they searched about, all of a sudden Begum came running back screaming, and with every mark of terror, and clung, as usual, to the Major when frightened.", "Where is the Bushboy?"]
["As soon as they reached within fifty paces, quite out of breath with their haste, they were saluted with the quah, quah, of a herd of baboons, which were perched at the edge of the rocks, and which threatened them in their usual way, standing on their fore-legs, and making as if they would fly at them.", "Now, then, what is to be done?"]
["\"Shall we fire?"]
["Desiring Bremen to shoot the animal through the head, our travelers then walked back to the caravan.", "What is the princess about?"]
["\"I have heard that when the pools dry up, the tortoises remain in the mud till the pools are filled up again,\" said Swinton.", "Are they good eating, Swinton?"]
["They then tried in vain to get at the water in the deep cleft, but finding it impossible, the caravan continued its course.", "How much more of this desert have we to traverse,\" said Alexander, \"before we come to the river?"]
["You escorted me safe through the country to ascertain a point in which you had not the slightest interest, and it would indeed be rewarding you very ill, if I were now to refuse to gratify you: but the fact is, I am gratifying myself at the same time.", "Well, I am very glad to hear you say so,\" replied the Major, \"as it makes my mind at ease; what time do you think it is, Swinton?"]
["Yes, for the sake of the cattle; the poor creatures deserve a couple of days' rest.", "Do you observe how the mimosas are torn up on the other side of the river?"]
["Why do they tear the trees up?"]
["On the third morning after their arrival at the Val, they set off, accompanied by the Hottentots, to the plain which they had spoken of; riding through magnificent groups of acacia or camelthorn trees, many of which were covered with the enormous nests of the social grosbeaks.", "Is not this splendid?"]
["\"There must be thousands and thousands,\" said Alexander.", "Tell me, Swinton, what beautiful animals are those of a purple color?", "And those red and yellow out there?"]
["At last the horses were too fatigued and too much out of wind to continue the pursuit, and they reined up.", "Well, Alexander, this has been sport, has it not?"]
["There were three animals which you did not observe,\" said Swinton; \"but it was impossible to get at them, they were so far off; but we must try for them another time.", "What were they?"]
["Omrah, run and tell that fellow to bring our horses here.\"", "Swinton, can birds and beasts talk, or can they not?"]
["Animals have instinct and reasoning powers, but not reason.\"", "Where is the difference?"]
["\"A very awkward customer, at all events,\" observed the Major.", "I presume a leaden bullet would not enter?"]
["We will go that way as soon as the Hottentots come up and take charge of our game.\"", "Does Swinton want to preserve one of these creatures?"]
["He gained the bushes without alarming the animals, and the party left behind were anxiously watching his motions, expecting him every moment to fire, when the Major suddenly turned round and came back at a hurried pace.", "What is the matter?"]
["I looked down, and it was the tail of a lioness, which fortunately was so busy watching the antelopes with her head the other way, that she did not perceive my being near her; whereupon I beat a retreat, as you have witnessed.\"", "Well, what shall we do now?"]
["CHAPTER XXV.", "Well, what sport have you had?"]
["I have killed the rhinoceros and elephant, and now I must have the giraffe; they can kill the two first animals in India, but the other is only to be had in this country.\"", "And when you meet again your Indian friends, you wish to say that you have killed what they have not?", "\"Certainly; what is the good of traveling so far, if one has not something to boast of when one returns?", "If I say I have hunted and killed the rhinoceros and elephant, they may reply to me, 'So have we;' but if I add the giraffe, that will silence them; don't you observe, Swinton, I then remain master of the field?"]
["There I have you, Major.", "I grant it,\" replied the Major; \"but what is that in the river--the back of a hippopotamus?"]
["The Major stating that it was their intention to hunt the giraffe, the Griquas informed them that they would not find the animal to the southward of the Val River, and they would have to cross over into the territories of the king Moselekatsee, who ruled over the Bechuana country, to the northward of the river; and that it would be very dangerous to attempt so to do without his permission; indeed, that there would be danger in doing so, even with it.", "Do you know any thing of this person, Swinton?"]
["Who is he?", "You have heard of Chaka, the king of the Zoolus, who conquered the whole country, as far as Port Natal to the eastward?"]
["In the arrangements of his army, he followed the same plans as Chaka, and has now become a most powerful monarch, and, they do say, is almost as great a tyrant and despot as Chaka himself was.", "But,\" said Alexander, \"I suppose if we send a message to him and presents, there will be no difficulty?"]
["Toward the evening the Matabili warrior who accompanied them pointed to a mimosa at a distance, and made signs to the Major that there was a giraffe.", "I can not see him--do you, Alexander?"]
["\"Your first essay in giraffe-hunting has been very successful,\" said Swinton, laughing, as they came up to him.", "Yes, we both threw very pretty summersets, did we not?"]
["\"I was about to propose it,\" said Swinton.", "Did you ever hunt the giraffe, Swinton?"]
["You are not perhaps aware that Moselekatsee is the deadly enemy of the Griquas, with whom he has had several severe conflicts, and that we are not very safe on that account?\"", "Why did not the Griquas say so?"]
["Depend upon it, as soon as the king hears of it, we shall be looked upon as spies, and he may send a party to cut us off.\"", "Have you said any thing to the Griquas?"]
["\"Well, they are bold enough, and so far are good traveling companions; but we certainly did not come here to fight,\" observed the Major.", "But does the Matabili with us know that they are Griquas?"]
["And also to keep off the lions,\" observed Alexander, \"which are not enemies to be despised.", "\"I think it is a very good plan; but why not have more men with you?"]
["Shortly afterward, another body with dark-colored shields, made their appearance, who came down and joined the first.", "Now, what shall we do?"]
["The Griquas were of the same opinion; and it was decided that they would remain there till daybreak, and then set off.", "But,\" said Alexander, \"shall we leave this before they can see us, or allow them to see us?"]
["He is a very intelligent boy,\" observed Alexander, \"and, traveling in this country, worth his weight in gold.", "I wish Swinton would make him over to me,\" said the Major; \"but, Alexander, do you observe what a change there is already in the country?"]
["There is no regular rainy season at all here, Swinton says; we may expect occasional torrents of rain during three months, but they are now very uncertain; the mountains attract the greater portion of the rain, and sometimes there will not be a shower on the plains for the whole year.\"", "How far shall we have to travel before we fall in with water again?"]
["It is now nine o'clock; let us yoke and push on as far as we can.\"", "I agree with you, Major,\" said Alexander; \"what do you say, Swinton?"]
["\"He is a child of the desert,\" replied Alexander; \"he has been brought up among lions, and where there is scarcity of water, and he has most wonderfully guided us in our path; but we are still in the desert, and have lost our companions.", "What must we do?"]
["The report of the rifle was answered by a roar; three lions bounded away from the rock, and went at a quick canter over the plain.", "Both our suppositions have proved correct,\" observed Alexander, as they walked up to where the antelope lay dead; \"but how are we to cook the animal?"]
["\"Well then, you must allow us to help him as well,\" replied the Major.", "How far are we now from the Modder River?"]
["In half an hour a party, consisting of our three travelers, Bremen, Omrah, and three of the most trusty of the Hottentots, who were all that they could mount, set off in the direction which they knew must have been taken, so as to conceal the cattle from the sight of those in the caravan; and it being a fine moonlight night, the keen eyes of Omrah tracked them for more than five miles, where they were at fault, as the traces of their hoofs were no longer to be seen.", "What shall we do now?"]
["The Major, at Alexander's request, had the lion and lioness set up in Leadbeater's best style, and the case had now arrived at the hall, and was brought up into Sir Charles's room, that he might have some idea of the animals with which they had had to contend; and there it remained, for the old gentleman would not allow it to be taken away.", "I must send out a present to that little Omrah,\" said Sir Charles, one morning, as he was conversing with the Major; \"what shall it be?"]
